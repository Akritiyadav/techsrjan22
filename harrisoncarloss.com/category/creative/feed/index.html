										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>In March of 2022, Disneyland Paris is set to launch what it bills as a </strong><strong>once-in-a-lifetime anniversary celebration.  </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After 30 years of dreams, the theme park announced its celebrations with a video on <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/services/marketing/social-media/">social media</a>, telling us the magic of Disneyland Paris will ignite like never before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The short video features old footage of the theme park, then at the end, Disneyland Paris showcases its anniversary logo of the number 30 that cleverly turns to reveal the famous Mickey Mouse ears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Magic as only Disney creates it. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To mark the occasion, as we might expect from the masterful creators of so many childhood and adult fantasies, Disney is promising “special experiences” across its Disneyland and Walt Disney Studios Park theme parks, as well as the rest of the resort, offering “a shining new era where guests will dream bigger, laugh louder and smile wider”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thirty years of fantastic fun.  </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was on April 12, 1992, that Disneyland® Paris officially welcomed guests for the first time after years of imagination, planning and development to bring Walt Disney’s magical dream to life in Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three decades later, the resort has continued to expand with new stories, characters and adventures, including beloved franchises such as Pixar, Star Wars and Marvel, becoming the number one tourist destination in Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goodbye Donald Duck, hello Captain America.  </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest additions to the resort include a brand new Marvel-themed hotel, inspired by a New York art gallery and packed with Marvel-themed artwork, as well as surprises including meet-and-greets with your favourite characters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disneyland Paris is also set to open a brand new Avengers Campus at its Walt Disney Studios Park, complete with a Spider-Man ride.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disneyland Paris cast members will be at the heart of the celebration, delivering the resort’s signature service and exceeding guests’ expectations each day by going above and beyond to make every visit special.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disneyland Paris isn’t the only one of the Disney Parks to be celebrating a special milestone in the coming months. Walt Disney World in Orlando is marking its 50th anniversary with 18 months of celebrations, beginning in October.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What a way to celebrate.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We love how this simple design that incorporates both the number 30 and a clever nod back to the origins of Disney with the Mickey Mouse ears. The results are an effective and impactful design that&#8217;s sure to go down in history as one of the best anniversary concepts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Q: What does it take to be a Paralympian? </strong></p>
<p><strong>A: There’s got to be something wrong with you.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Channel 4’s gritty Tokyo 2020 ‘Superhuman’ Paralympics campaign was genuinely stirring stuff from 4Creative, the channel’s in-house creative agency. It was based on the premise that to be a Paralympian, there’s got to be something wrong with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The implication was, of course, that you must be prepared for the blood, sweat, sacrifice and dedication demanded of a Paralympic athlete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A human approach.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for the 2020 games, rather than following in the same ‘super’ vein as previous Paralympian games campaigns, Channel 4 presented us with a more realistically human approach asking us to acknowledging just what these incredible athletes have to go through to compete at the games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We spotted an opportunity to present Paralympians in a way they hadn’t been shown before – by pointing a camera at the realities of their lives and, as with any elite athlete, the sacrifices they make in pursuit of greatness,” explained Lynsey Atkin, 4Creative’s exec creative director, on capturing the blood, sweat, sacrifices and dedication it takes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Olympians in the making.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Made by Oscar-nominated Bradford Young, and set to a freshly-recorded version of Bugsy Malone’s So You Want to Be a Boxer? by Jay Prince, the film candidly shows various British Paralympians preparing for Tokyo, including Ali Jawad, David Smith, Ellie Simmonds, Jody Cundy, Jordanne Whiley, Kadeena Cox and Kylie Grimes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the Olympics being postponed due to the pandemic, the ad had been in development for 18 months and was filmed in mid-May 2021 over a period of two weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure the ad was authentic, 4Creative worked closely with the athletes, who helped to write the script. “Everything you see in the film was inspired by real-life experiences of the Paralympians featured, all of whom generously shared their stories with us,” said Lynsey Atkins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As well as working closely with British Paralympians, 4Creative also liaised with the International Paralympic Committee, the British Paralympics Association and Scope, all of whom provided invaluable insight and guidance in shaping the campaign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>It’s not rude to stare.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Channel 4’s outdoor and print campaign followed the same vein, turning the social stigma of ‘not staring’ into something positive, with ads proclaiming ‘It’s rude not to stare’, along with ‘like the Olympic 800m, but faster’, and ‘Sub 2hr marathons? We do those sitting down’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was all great stuff, using superbly garish colours, together with copy that was both clever and provocative. The kind of work you wish you’d done yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However you look at it, this is a wonderful campaign that focused brilliantly on the fact that being a Paralympian is more about mental determination than disability. Heroic and uplifting, you can’t help but be inspired by these super humans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>As we come to the end of restrictions, Uncommon Creative Studio created a campaign for Google centred around the Google search bar. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Josh Tenser, creative director at <a href="https://www.uncommon.london/">Uncommon</a>, the brief was to drive meaning and emotion back into an incredible brand with perhaps the most important product on the planet &#8211; because people have started to take the magic of what <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google Search</a> can do for granted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So at the start of the ad we’re told that there are 68 million people in the UK, and we’re all searching for something. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As searching is what Google is all about, one simple question after another is entered in the search bar &#8211; included such things as ‘What is reopening anxiety?’, ‘How to remember dad’, ‘Can we hug now?’ and ‘Is kissing safe?’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What we’ve been missing. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We see a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEfhyYJgcZ4">series of poignant moments</a> of joy or loss, anxiety, hope and happiness; cameos of normal, everyday life to remind us of things the British public have been missing during the pandemic. The whole thing is held together by a kaleidoscopic backing of UK dance music and ambient SFX.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Making ads for over a year in the pandemic has tuned us in really tightly to the pressure points in the collective psyche,” said Tenser, “and this was the well we drew from &#8211; everything we have learned in the past year.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Real life searches.  </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that once they had the narrative they wanted, they gave the script &#8211; in essence a sequence of search queries &#8211; to Google’s data insight team. They then cross-referenced what had been written with the most realistic possible live searches, adjusting the script to make it true to what people would actually type into the search bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A mirror of life. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Said Tenser, “Google isn’t just for the small transactions like banana bread recipes and directions to dry cleaners. We often search for the big stuff, too. It was very much intended to be a mirror up to U.K. life, U.K. people. Something that smelled like us &#8211; and only us &#8211; right now.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nils Leonard, co-founder, Uncommon Creative Studio added: “Trivial terms tell the story of our hopes and unknowns, the smallest search can mean everything. We find each other there. Uncommon are proud to bring the Google brand story to the UK as we all enter the Summer of our lives.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The campaign premiered Tuesday June 1 during Channel 4’s ‘Great British Bake Off: The Professionals’, going on to cover all channels, accompanied by digital &amp; poster OOH across iconic locations in the UK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Searching for more.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google has really tugged on heartstrings with the latest campaign and it&#8217;s clear to see the impact of the use of data to create authenticity. In a time where we&#8217;re looking to move on from Covid-19 restrictions, they&#8217;ve really managed to embrace the mood of the nation &#8211; both the good and the bad &#8211; to create an ad that exudes optimism in the time when it&#8217;s needed most.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Try €10,000. That’s how much Irish bookmaker Paddy Power has <a href="https://news.paddypower.com/football/2021/06/06/save-our-game-paddy-power-england-euro-2020-10k-every-goal/">pledged to donate to Irish Football</a> for every goal England scores in the tournament, in a new campaign named ‘#SaveOurGame’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Donations will be doubled to €20,000 if either of the England side’s two Irish players, Jack Grealish or Declan Rice, succeed in scoring for England in a pledge called ‘The Back Stabber’ bonus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The campaign hopes to bring English and Irish football fans to put their stormy past aside for the tournament and come together in appreciation of a cordial win-win situation that should have both cheering in support of a common sporting cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then again, the fact that the Republic of Ireland squad failed to qualify for the tournament could have something to do with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The campaign kicked off with a full-page ad in The Irish Times under the headline “Come on you boys in white!” showing an Ireland player’s shirt being ripped open to reveal a red England flag on the player’s chest. This was accompanied by the installation of an outsize 100 x 56m St. George’s Cross on the Bray Wanderers Ground in County Wicklow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Irish pundit and former Ireland international Eamon Dunphy, and former Crystal Palace and Hull City star Damien Delaney, who were both on hand to add encouragement to Irish fans, both appear in a tongue-in-cheek video, with a cameo from Paddy Power himself, to launch the #SaveOurGame campaign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Said a Paddy Power spokesperson, “Irish football fans are the best in the world, and we know they would do anything for the good of the game. We’re not asking them to pledge their allegiance to the Queen. We haven’t totally lost the plot. But for the duration of the Euros, for every goal England score is money in the bank for Irish football.” He added, “We want to give Irish fans a reason to cheer this summer &#8211; even if it slips out accidentally!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paddy Power are well known for their daring marketing; in their past campaigns they&#8217;ve pushed boundaries and even got them in hot water for <a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/paddy-power-pistorius-ad-brings-advertising-into-disrepute/">some particularly bad taste ads</a>. But we love this bold move from the team &#8211; and while we don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll get Irish fans singing Three Lions anytime soon &#8211; it proves that an England goal isn&#8217;t always bad news, especially not for grassroots Irish football.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>It’s a simple fact that when things are designed better, they work better. This is true not just for the design of products, but for the graphic design we use to represent and promote them. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great design works not only on a conscious level, but on a subliminal level. It influences how we feel about things and what they mean to us. But in today’s overcrowded marketplace only the very best designs stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Great design sells itself. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/">Apple</a> is one of the best examples. From the design of the <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/services/creative/#Branding">branding</a>, through to the design of Apple’s products themselves, you get a strong and consistent message and a lasting impression that says this is how good things should look, and how well they should work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Great design makes you stand out. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We buy what we like the look of. The same goes for graphics. A strong visual design can jump off the page and make your business look more credible and reliable. Great design also says authenticity and bolsters your reputation by underlining your strategy and messaging. Great design reflects and reinforces your business ethos and purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Great design works hard online. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visual appeal strongly influences online behaviour. If a potential customer finds your website unattractive or hard to navigate, chances are you’ll lose them. That’s why you must have a beautifully designed site that makes the most effective use of colour, imagery, white space and graphics to guide a consumer to key information such as available and relevant products/services and prices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Great design creates the best first impression. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, it takes only about 50 milliseconds for potential customers to form an opinion on your website, so that first impression really counts. They set the tone for the rest of your business relationship. A good <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/services/creative/#Graphic-Design">graphic designer</a> will create consistent, credible and memorable design for your brand across all visual media.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Great design speaks a thousand words. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great graphic design can push boundaries with boldly innovative visual ideas that communicate with an audience instantly, below the level of thought. The best graphic design has the power to future-proof a brand by creating and combining visual elements in ways that are as distinctive online as they are on the printed page. All of which is why great design can work wonders for your bottom line.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>BBC tear up and set fire to their own billboards to mimic what we’re doing to the planet. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>In the BBC series <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08xc2lh">A Perfect Planet</a>, Sir David Attenborough tells us that oceans, sunlight, weather and volcanoes are powerful yet fragile forces that together allow life to flourish in astonishing diversity. They make Earth truly unique &#8211; a perfect planet, teeming with life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November, the team at <a href="https://www.bbccreative.co.uk/">BBC Creative</a> joined with <a href="https://talonoutdoor.com/">Talon Outdoor</a> to begin promoting the series through a number of posters erected across the UK displaying shots of our miraculous world and its extraordinary inhabitants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BBC Creative also created a lengthy trailer covering the series &#8211; oceans, volcano, the sun, humans and weather.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the final episode of the series, Attenborough warns us that our ‘Perfect Planet’ is a fragile system, and today there’s a new force. One so powerful it threatens life on Earth. Human activity is now so dominant that it’s disrupting the forces of nature, and the vital habitats that life needs to survive on Earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the show drew to a close, BBC Creative used its own billboards to demonstrate how humans are a destructive force on the planet in a bigger campaign focusing on the climate change crisis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one site they tore fragments of the billboard away to reveal the remnants of hard-hitting imagery behind. In another site the billboard has been designed to make it look like it has been set on fire to boldly illustrate that wildfire destroys habitats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>James Cross, creative director at BBC Creative, said the campaign had to shock. “It needs to highlight the fact that BBC nature series aren’t all about the good stuff, the wow and the wonder. There is actually a serious message that in more recent times, the corporation is leaning towards.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He added that the PR value in doing an execution good enough to be talked about and shared online far outweighs any installation costs. It’s already had way more column inches than the average TV commercial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All well and good, but it’ll take a great deal more than a few cleverly manipulated billboards to halt what is already a very real climate crisis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Sir David himself makes clear in the series, “To preserve our planet, we need to act now. And if we do that, there will still be time to restore the ecological balance that once made this Earth our perfect planet.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The latest <a href="https://www.leoburnett.co.uk/">Leo Burnett</a> campaign for McDonald’s, promoting McDelivery and featuring half of the iconic McDonald’s ‘golden arches’, ran nationally from 8 February until 21 February.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be hard to imagine a clearer and cleverer graphic device to get over the message that your McDonald’s food delivery could take off from a local <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/gb/en-gb.html">McDonald’s</a> and beam straight into your home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was simple and instantly recognisable, and deserved the applause it received for communicating its message most succinctly, with a simple ‘we deliver’ message and not a logo in sight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there were the equally minimalist Leo Burnett ads for McDonald’s that featured just lists of ingredients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again there was no mention of the brand name. Instead we had some of the brand’s most popular food items, such as the Big Mac, the Sausage &amp; Egg McMuffin and the Filet-O-Fish, reduced to a word list of their main components.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Sausage &amp; Egg McMuffin, for instance, becomes ‘Muffin, Egg, Sausage, Cheese, Muffin’. Each word is stacked on top of the other, mimicking the arrangement of the food itself, and is coloured in a shade reminiscent of the ingredient it names.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>London-based agency Leo Burnett teamed up with Minneapolis-based designer <a href="http://www.dschwen.com/">David Schwen</a> to create the Iconic Stacks campaign for outdoor billboards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Said Pete Heyes, creative director at Leo Burnett, “McDonald’s is a leader. Only a handful of global brands can communicate like this. The redacted and graphic nature of this latest campaign exudes the confidence McDonald’s and its iconic products deserve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“David Schwem’s graphical style helps the viewer literally build the product in their mind,” said Heyes. “The colour palette is gentle, not forced. It uses the visual truth of the products and the packaging. The type doesn’t shout. It’s humble. It’s confident.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minimalism in the name of design is all well and good, and while it works so well for McDelivery, much of the pleasure to be derived from the fare McDonald’s serves up is in the actual look of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call me old fashioned, but you can’t eat coloured words, even when they’re pretending to be food. And no way do they get your mouth watering like the sight of a juicy burger with cheese running down it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Bold. Simple. Retro. They all describe the King of burgers’ new rebranding look, the first in 20 years, by creative agency Jones Knowles Ritchie. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rebrand serves up a complete new visual identity right across the fast food brand’s packaging, menu design, merchandise, décor and social media with elements focused on replicating the shapes of BK’s menu items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mouthwatering, big and bold. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Burger King describes its new designs as ‘mouthwatering, big and bold, playfully irreverent and proudly true’. Like its pre-1999 logo design, the new logo has the Burger King name once again sandwiched between the two halves of the burger bun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The big difference with this new design is the introduction of a plumply juicy new typeface – called Flame &#8211; that you could almost bite into, in colours that are ‘rich and bold’. Apparently the font is inspired by the shapes of the brand’s food in being ‘rounded, bold and yummy’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A logo evolution. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jkrglobal.com/">JKR</a> executive creative director Lisa Smith said, “The new minimalist logo seamlessly meets the brand evolution of the times”. In fact inspiration for the typeface came from looking into Burger King’s archives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Over the years the brand often used typefaces like Cooper Black,” she said. “We wanted to do a modern take on those kinds of type, making it digital-friendly for the future.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The striking simplicity of the new logo’s flat design, block colours and bold shapes works well across all platforms, including digitally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Inspired by burgers. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While these combine to give the new look a decidedly retro feel, they were inspired by the food itself and Burger King’s trademark flame-grilling process: Firey Red, Flaming Orange and Barbeque Brown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Burger King’s redesigned packaging also features ‘playful illustrations of ingredients’ emblazoned with adjectives that describe the food, like ‘crispy’ and ‘tasty’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rebrand uses the warm colours and pictures of ingredients to redesign uniforms for staff with a deep brown as their base colour. This  is paired with the new logo and trim in red, orange and white.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Merchandising, menu boards, restaurant signage and marketing assets will also include the font and revised colour palette.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of a design trend towards simplicity and fun that communicates more readily across a wide range of digital and printed media, <a href="https://www.burgerking.co.uk/">Burger King</a>’s new rebranding scores pretty high. Expect to see more of the same from other brands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You thought Apple did cool ads? Well Chilly’s new campaign for their Series 2 drinking bottles and cups is just as cool, and gives <a href="https://www.chillysbottles.com/uk">Chilly’s</a> an unrivalled style lead in the reusable bottles market.</p>
<p><strong>10 years of Chilly&#8217;s</strong></p>
<p>Chilly’s was founded in 2010 by James Butterfield and Tim Bouscarle, two guys who wanted to give people the ability to always have cold water on-the-go, without having to buy single-use plastic water bottles.</p>
<p>Their mission was to accelerate the adoption and everyday use of reusable products. They aimed to do this by ‘creating products for an active urban lifestyle, with the perfect balance of distinctive style and unrivalled performance.’</p>
<p><strong>Performance AND Design</strong></p>
<p>Their approach resulted in the original iconic Chilly’s bottle, recognised for its distinctive designs and never-let-you-down performance. As Chilly’s website says, they keep your hot drinks hot for 12 hours, and your cold drinks cold for 24 hours.</p>
<p>They also made you look pretty cool. You could get a Chilly’s bottle with a graphic image of London, Paris, New York or Sydney printed on it. Or gradient colours and finishes such as stainless steel, chrome, neon, and a whole spread of other colours and designs. Or an Emma Bridgewater design (we are from <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/contact/stoke/">Stoke</a> after all).</p>
<p><strong>Eco-friendly ethos</strong></p>
<p>In line with the company’s aim to accelerate the adoption of reusable products, Chilly’s then partnered with non profit <a href="https://www.citytosea.org.uk/">City to Sea</a>, who work to prevent plastic pollution in the ocean.</p>
<p>In an award-winning Campaign to promote the Chilly’s Refill and encourage the reduction of single-use plastics, Chilly’s introduced the Sea Life range with four new designs to coincide with World Oceans Day, featuring the work of Cornwall artist Will the Artist. As part of that campaign, Chilly’s donated 10% of all sales to City to Sea.</p>
<p><strong>A new dawn, a new design</strong></p>
<p>Now, after 3 years of design work, we have the Series 2 Chilly’s Bottle, ‘not a redesign but an evolution of the original iconic design’ say Chilly’s.</p>
<p>From the customisable carry loop to soft touch antimicrobial drinking collar, everything about Series 2 has evolved. It features an even more sleekly modern and stylish bottle, beautifully designed to combine the convenience of a plastic water bottle, with the high performance technology and eco-friendly benefits of a traditional flask.</p>
<p>For Series 2 there’s again a Chilly’s coffee cup. It too has double walled technology to keep your hot drinks hot inside while staying cool to the touch on the outside in typical Chilly’s style. Not to mention making you look cool.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Faced with the grim prospect of a yuletide lockdown, consumers are counting on advertisers to entertain them with some lively festive cheer this Christmas.  </strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://go.unruly.co/l/50182/2020-10-13/dc1jr6">2020 Holiday Insights Report</a> by video advertising companies Unruly and Tremor Video found that after all they’ve had to go though this year, 47% of people want Christmas ads that make them happy, 44% want ads to give them a warm feeling, and 31% are longing for a seasonal dose of nostalgia. The last thing 33% of them want is to be reminded of the pandemic.</p>
<p>A quick look at this year’s early crop of Christmas crackers reveals that most of those angles have been covered.</p>
<p><strong>Back to our festive roots. </strong></p>
<p>It’s welcome back to the star of previous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL56Z5StIUY">Aldi</a> seasonal spectaculars, <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/aldi-christmas-musical-feast-and-the-return-of-kevin-the-carrot/">Kevin the Carrot</a>. This time around we see the plucky little vegetable parachute from a jet fighter, hitch a ride aboard a hedgehog in the snow, meet with Santa, and finally arrive home, emerging through the catflap to be reunited with the family for Christmas dinner. What a guy!</p>
<p><strong>Real Christmases aren’t perfect.  </strong></p>
<p>There’s a funny Christmas campaign from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR_ZVamR5YE">Very</a> telling people to quit pretending Christmas is perfect, and embrace the very real things that lead up to December 25<sup>th</sup>. In this ad, that includes the very human &#8211; and often imperfect &#8211; things that go awry. As a picture of how Christmas really is, it works.</p>
<p><strong>A touch of seasonal magic. </strong></p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FoNQygNHls">Argos</a> comes the second chapter in its ‘Book of Dreams’ campaign that taps into how people feel when flicking through the pages of its Christmas gift guide. In the spot, two girls spot a box of magic tricks in the guide, and suddenly they have their own magic show using merchandise in the ‘Book of dreams,’ aka the Argo Christmas gift guide.</p>
<p><strong>Making dreams to true.  </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQdLD6kk960">Amazon</a> has chosen to use the power of dreams to combat the restrictions caused by the pandemic. Their ad tells the inspiring story of 17-year-old French ballet dancer, Taïs Vinolo, whose character must train from home due to the pandemic. Set to an arrangement of Queen’s ‘The Show Must Go On’, her sister and the community around her pull together to give her a stage and an audience in an emotional finale. Definitely a warm feeling.</p>
<p><strong>A goat for Christmas.  </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgIigoL1Lro">TK Maxx’s</a> Christmas ad features a small goat wearing a pink designer outfit &#8211; and why not? &#8211; strolling through a snowy landscape as the farmer looks on tenderly. “Did you buy the goat a designer outfit?” his wife asks. “Yes,” he admits, “she’s had such a hard year, she bloomin’ well deserves it.” The message, if you didn’t figure it out, is that after the year we’ve had, everyone deserves to feel special this Christmas. Even goats who shop at TK Maxx.</p>
<p><strong>Happiness, made with Lego. </strong></p>
<p>As part of its ‘Rebuild the World’ brand campaign, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW8zDi_smus">Lego’s ad</a> brings us an adventure with stories, animals and vehicles based on existing Lego products; princess knights calm dragons, astronauts celebrate their marriage with dinosaurs and giant chicken, and a Star Wars AT-AT. It’s practically a Christmas panto.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook means togetherness. </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrQJRLzGBGk">Facebook’s Portal</a> uses footballing luvvy Ian Wright to launch a brand new holiday campaign showing us how the whole family can hang out together during the holiday and keeping their traditions. Each family moment in the campaign showcases how a different feature of Portal is helping the Wrights feel like they’re together, with the sentiment: ‘If you can’t be there, feel there.’</p>
<p><strong>An Asda price Christmas. </strong></p>
<p>This year, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR_nRBy92oQ">Asda</a> was one of the first of the major supermarkets to launch its Christmas ad from AMV BBDO. Featuring the tagline, ‘the Christmas we all need, at the prices we want’, their spot brings back Sunny and his wife and kids as they indulge in the many seasonal goodies that Asda has on offer. Ending with the thought ‘Christmas is going to be different this year, so let’s really make the most of it,’ the ad pretty much sums up the general mood of us all right now.</p>
