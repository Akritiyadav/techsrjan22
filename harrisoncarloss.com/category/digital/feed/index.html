										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Er&#8230;first, what’s a Google Partner agency? </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>A Google Partner agency is an agency who has achieved Google Partner status and is a recognised expert in handling digital <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/services/marketing/">marketing</a> for its clients through the use of Google Ads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use a Google Partner agency and not only will you get the benefits of using experts to promote a business’s products and services on Google Search, YouTube, and other sites across the web. But it will also unlock a wealth of exclusive extras to help your campaigns perform to their fullest potential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/why-you-should-work-with-a-google-partner-agency/">Harrison Carloss gained Google Partner status</a>, meaning that we’re even more dedicated to getting better results for less in your Google Ads campaigns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>And what are Google Ads?   </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google Ads are part of a Google program that uses pay-per-click (PPC) advertising. PPC advertising is in the form of paid ads that appear in Google search engine results. Google Ads are a highly effective means of reaching your target audience, so they can be one of the most profitable ways to get new leads and conversions for your business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Right. So, what about the benefits of using a Google Partner agency in 2022? </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply put, when you work with a <a href="https://www.google.com/partners/work-with-a-partner/">Google Partner agency</a> you qualify for some valuable offers. Here’s what’s changing in 2022:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>For 2022, more credits. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year Google have increased the value of Google Ads credits from £75 to £400 to help new subscribers get a stronger start with their campaigns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>More time to qualify. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also for 2022, new clients get more time to qualify. New accounts now have 60 days instead of 30 days to spend £400 to qualify for the £400 credit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Only for Google Partners. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These high value offers are a benefit reserved just for Google Partners and Premier Google Partners to help them stand out in the marketplace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s now even better to work with a Google Partner agency like Harrison Carloss. If you’re looking to improve your <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/ppc/">PPC</a> account – or even if you’re just starting out in the wild world of paid search – get in touch with the team and we will be able to advise on the best course of action to help optimise and grow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>How Amazon created e-commerce. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In just its first-quarter earnings this year, Amazon reported a revenue of at least $75.45 billion. But nobody really needs to be told how big or successful Amazon is, or that it’s had an overwhelming influence on the marketing industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/services/digital/ecommerce/">e-commerce</a> has evolved in the last 20 years, it was Amazon that did the most to alter how we buy, sell, and transact. During that time, the company has not only been able to adapt to the constant changes in shopping and technology trends, it’s been among the most innovative companies in the world, and now claims most of the e-commerce market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Amazon changed the economics of how we shop. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to survey data from Pew, in 2000 only <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/12/19/online-shopping-and-purchasing-preferences/">22% of Americans had ever shopped online</a>, now 80% do, at least somewhat regularly. From its beginning in 1995 as a bookseller, its ability to innovate and constantly reinvent itself made it the powerhouse that dominates the market today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While most other online stores at the time stuck to one type of product or service, Amazon did the exact opposite and expanded what it offered to its consumers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This decision to diversify their services with the market trends allowed them to continually meet the interests and expectations of their customers. As a result, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/">Amazon</a> cemented itself as a leader in the ecommerce market, helping it evolve to the customer’s benefit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A steady marketing evolution. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 2000s, besides selling almost everything you could ever want, Amazon opened up its platform to third-party retailers, and now sells more than 12 million different products, from sausages to sunflower seeds. This also meant it became easy for customers to compare prices and products, and see reviews, in a way that was impossible in person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1997 Amazon introduced one-click shopping. Until 2017, Amazon was the only online retailer that offered this purchasing method to customers, where customers didn’t need to re-enter their information if they had shopped there previously. Instead, with just one click, the order would be ready.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2005 it launched <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Video/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=3010085031">Amazon Prime</a>, streamlining the ordering process, allowing customers to choose their ordering process, receive a free two-day or same-day delivery, and stream their favourite movies and TV shows. Amazon then expanded this with their return policy that allows dissatisfied customers to return their product for a full refund.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>And now we have the Amazon Effect. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazon’s impact in the ecommerce world is often summarized in one phrase: <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amazon-effect.asp#:~:text=The%20Amazon%20Effect%20is%20the,the%20increase%20in%20online%20shopping.&amp;text=Online%20shopping%20provides%20convenience%20and,touching%20a%20product%20before%20buying.">The Amazon Effect</a>, which refers to the difficulty many companies face when directly competing with Amazon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazon’s huge product selection, fast shipping 7 days a week, free returns, low prices and ‘Prime’ subscription service, all create high customer expectations for any retailer hoping to compete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But of course this is just one aspect of how Amazon has changed ecommerce, because if other retailers do hope to compete, they must follow Amazon’s example by adapting their services to better meet their customers’ needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Harrison Carloss we can integrate delivery platforms directly into your ecommerce <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/services/digital/websites/">website</a>, making delivery quicker and seamless for both you and you’re customers. <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/contact/">Get in touch</a> with our team today to find out more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The digital difference.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case it had somehow escaped your notice, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a dramatic effect on e-commerce sales worldwide. Beginning in 2020, online was practically the only way to shop in safety, and global e-commerce sales doubled during the first three months of lockdown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A survey of around 3,700 consumers in nine emerging and developed economies by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has shown how these consumers have made the greatest shift to online shopping during the pandemic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How the world shops now. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over half those surveyed in countries that include Brazil, China, Germany, Italy, the Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, South Africa, Switzerland and Turkey, shop online more frequently and rely on the internet more for news, health-related information and digital entertainment since the pandemic started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UNCTAD survey also shows that online purchases have risen by 6-10% across most product categories, with the biggest increase seen across sectors such as IT and electronics, gardening and DIY, pharmaceuticals, education, household products and personal care products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>US digital spending up 44%. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the US, consumers spent $861.12 billion online with retailers in 2020, up 44.0% from $598.02 billion in 2019, according to the latest Digital Commerce 360 analysis. Online spending represented 21.3% of total retail sales last year, compared with 15.8% the year prior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the record, 24% of men were found to be shopping online more frequently during the pandemic, compared to 18% of women. One third of men, compared to 25% of women, said that Covid-19 was impacting how much they spend on products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A survey of US and UK consumers found that 96% of Millennials and Gen Zs are concerned about the pandemic and its effects on the economy. 30% of millennials now shop more frequently online, with 24% of Gen Z, 20% of Gen X and just 8% of Baby Boomers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A change for the better? </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The shift in consumer behaviour has found some industries much better prepared to ramp up their digital offering than others, with the result that many businesses are lagging behind, often working with outdated systems and processes that have left them struggling to cope with increased demand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks certain that the changes forced by the pandemic in shopping behaviour will continue in the post-Covid world, which makes this the time when all industries should focus their efforts on creating a first class digital experience for their customers. It’s an e-commerce world now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Looking to overhaul your e-commerce?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We offer a comprehensive e-commerce <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/website-design-and-development/">web design</a> package to give your products the best platform for sales.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is a Google Partner agency?  </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Google Partner agency is a recognised expert at handling digital <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/services/marketing/">marketing</a> for its clients by using Google Ads to promote a business’s products and services on Google Search, YouTube, and other sites across the web. The Google Partner badge is awarded to agencies who have the latest Google Ads expertise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ok, so what is Google Ads?  </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google Ads is a Google program that uses <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/ppc/">pay-per-click (PPC) advertising</a> &#8211; paid ads that appear in Google search engine results. Google Ads are proven to be a highly effective means of reaching your target audience, and can be one of the most profitable ways to get new leads and conversions for your business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are the benefits of using a Google Partner agency? </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only companies with proven expertise in Google Ads can become a Google Partner, which means they’ve passed Google Ads product certification exams, manage a minimum account spend and have the latest product information. Partners are also able to attend advanced training sessions to keep abreast of PPC best practices, so when you choose a Partner agency, you’ll know they are keeping up with PPC strategies as they evolve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What does Google ads product certification mean? </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Google Partner can be certified in numerous types of Google ads, including search, mobile, video, shopping, and display advertising, and have staff who are highly trained to work with Google Ads. With these expert qualifications, a Google Partner will be able to create a more effective campaign for your budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Google Partners work with the latest PPC information. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The digital world is constantly evolving and changing, so it’s vital to stay on top of these changes to make the most of your digital marketing plan. That’s why Google requires their Partners to take recertification exams to ensure that they stay up to speed with the latest changes. By choosing a Google Partner agency, you’re benefiting from all of the most up-to-date changes with Google Ads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Google Partners have access to beta features. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google has numerous new and innovative features that they test before the public gets access to them &#8211; typically the latest updates to the Google Ads system. So obviously, when you work with a Google Partner agency, you get the benefits of these beta features when your agency integrates them into your plan, all helping to keep you competitive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Google Partners work directly with Google. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another big advantage when using a Google Partner is that as your PPC ads are run through Google’s platform, one of the top search engine platforms, Google Partners work directly with Google, who provides Partners with their own team. So they can speak to Google directly for account and technical support, or to address any problems that might arise.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>We recently achieved Google Partner status. Why not <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/contact/">get in touch</a> to see how we can use our Google expertise to help you?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>WordPress is the world’s most popular platform for building a website, and it’s easy to see why. Accessible, incredibly flexible, secure with endless possibilities </strong><strong>WordPress runs 40% of the world’s websites.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WordPress is easy to use.      </strong></p>
<p>As the ultimate content management system (CMS), the user-friendly <a href="https://en-gb.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> interface makes it easy to manage, modify, and publish content (images, text, videos, etc.) At the same time it’s so powerful and versatile that it can be used to build a complex bespoke website to fit your business needs perfectly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WordPress is open source.</strong></p>
<p>That means its software is free to download, install, use and modify to create any kind of website. As such the platform has a huge community of followers constantly working to improve its functionality. Though while the WordPress software itself is free, you need a domain name, theme and web hosting to install it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WordPress has thousands of functional plugins.</strong></p>
<p>Due to its popularity, WordPress has become the go-to platform developers to write their own add-ons, or <a href="https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/">plugins</a>. Plugins are like apps for your WordPress site, and can be used to install add new features to a website. There are over 58,000 plugins available in the WordPress directory, so whether you want an online store via the <a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a> addon or a private WordPress blog, the platform can expand your site’s overall functionality so it looks and performs exactly as you’d like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WordPress is secure.</strong></p>
<p>Despite having a bad rep in the past, the WordPress platform is audited regularly by hundreds of developers to overcome security vulnerabilities and ensure their security measures stay ahead of hacker tactics. With on-going website maintenance, your WordPress site can keep up-to-speed with the latest in design, functionality and security, ensuring it’s always online and open for business.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Why WordPress is our platform of choice.</strong></p>
<p>At Harrison Carloss, we’ve used WordPress for years and have a portfolio of <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/services/digital/#Website">websites</a> from the most simple, to those with complex integrations to ensure that the client has the website that they need to build and grow their business effectively. We use WordPress as the foundation and build a bespoke website on top including the design and functionality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use templates for WordPress sites but it’s something that we avoid – templates tend to limit your site including restrictions on what changes you can make, implementing new functionality, tracking marketing activity and of course, the design is not unique. Your brand and business is unique so why would you not make your website unique?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We find WordPress sites are fit for purpose for most businesses, clients find it easy to make basic updates to their own websites without being tied in or the age-old agency model of charging clients for every little change – it’s something we like to avoid at Harrison Carloss! We like to equip clients with the knowledge and understanding to enable clients to manage their own content on their websites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a new website, a refresh or need some advice, <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/contact/">get in touch</a> with the team.</p>

Pay-per-click advertising, branded or influencer-generated content, and display ads are all examples of paid social media.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paid social media on each platform differs depending on the campaign and audience, but each platform has the ad tools to help you create, schedule, and post ads that effectively target your audience.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h5><strong>Facebook</strong></h5>
<p>Facebook Targeted Ads let you show ads to your customers based on their behaviour. This is useful in that you can keep advertising to your existing Facebook customers based on what Facebook tells you about their use of the app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The analytics <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> gives you lets you experiment by trying different ad formats to see what your audience engages with. Facebook will automatically show your ads to people who are most likely to find your ads relevant. Other tools allow you to define an audience based on criteria such as age, interests, geography and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Twitter</strong></h5>
<p>Twitter paid ads aren’t as obvious as ads on other social channels because they look like regular tweets. That’s probably why <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> reports that 41% of users purchase a product after seeing an ad within a month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twitter has various types of ad for you to choose based on your goals, with software built into the platform to let you target a specific demographic. And with ad settings based on your budget, you can choose how frequently your ad will be seen, and the kind of ad to run.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h5><strong>Instagram</strong></h5>
<p>Instagram has over a billion users and is built around sharing images and videos. As their website says, people come to Instagram to be inspired and discover things they care about, including content from brands and businesses like yours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Instagram business account lets you run ads from your <a href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram</a> account. Your budget is then tied to the length of the ad run. And with so many different visual styles running on Instagram, there are different ways to leverage paid social media, such as Image or Video.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h5><strong>LinkedIn</strong></h5>
<p>Most people know LinkedIn as a highly valuable tool to network with like-minded professionals. But LinkedIn also has the potential to reach 60 million decision-makers, making it by far the most popular social media platform for lead generation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On <a href="http://linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> you can run campaigns around clearly defined goals such as brand awareness, lead generation, or social engagement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LinkedIn’s targeted ads let you set keywords and select audiences by category. You can also play around with ad formats to discover which is most effective. You can even engage prospects with dynamic ads automatically personalised to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Paid social media works for any size of business</strong></h5>
<p>Once you know how to use them (and which ones are best for your audience) you can soon begin reaping the benefits for your brand and get the highest ROI.</p>
<p>Looking to get social? Talk to our <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/contact/">expert team</a> today to see how we can help your business use paid social to reach your marketing goals.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are Core Web Vitals? </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Core Web Vitals are factors that Google takes into account when judging the overall quality of user experience on a webpage. They’re designed to measure how users experience the speed, responsiveness, and visual stability of a page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply put, Google will look at how your website is built and maintained from a technical standpoint, and considers areas where this could impact how could impact a user’s experience on your site. For example, if your website is slow then the user is more likely to bounce off the page or, if they do stay, have a worse, more frustrating time when on your site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Are Core Web Vitals important? </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You bet. From June, Google are introducing an algorithm update that will turn Core Web Vitals into ranking signals. This means that your site’s rank in Google will now be influenced by these factors, alongside more traditional points such as the site’s relevancy and backlink profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new ‘page experience’ signal will combine <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9205520?hl=en">Core Web Vitals</a> with signals for mobile-friendliness, safe-browsing, HTTPS-security and intrusive interstitial guidelines. A lot of these factors have been part of best practice for SEO before now, so it’ll come as no surprise that Google are looking to include these within their algorithm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Google, “These signals measure how users perceive the experience of interacting with a web page, and contribute to our ongoing work to ensure people get the most helpful and enjoyable experience from the web.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google released this information to provide some guidance on improving website quality and user experience, so each Core Web Vitals component should be carefully considered. All in all, if you’re looking to get ahead in the Google ranks, looking at your site’s Core Web Vitals is a great place to start! We’d recommend using <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about">Google Search Console</a> to keep track of your site’s Core Web Vitals and help make improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The three main Core Web Vitals categories are: </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Largest Contentful Paint (LPC) </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LCP measures the loading performance of your website. For Google to see your website as successful in this area, the largest elements of content on the page should be fully loaded in 2.5 seconds or less. (This might not happen if your website contains render-blocking Javascript and CSS, for example.) So, work on reducing this load time to an absolute minimum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First Input Delay (FID)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FID measures how interactive your website is by measuring the time between when a user first interacts with a page and when the browser processes the interaction. <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/">Google</a> considers a FID of less than 100 milliseconds strong. Minimising the main thread blocking time is one way to reduce first input delay, as well as reducing or delaying the impact of third-party code that isn’t critical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CLS measures how visually stable the website is by looking at any visual elements on the page that change position or size and affect the surrounding content. (For example, motion graphics might be great visually, but not ideal if this causes a button to move so a user can’t easily click it.) An ideal measurement of layout shift is less than 0.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What it all means.  </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply put, there’s no question that in today’s hyper-competitive marketplace, it’s more important than ever to have a website that provides a fantastic user experience. And as user experience can significantly impact your SEO and how your website ranks, implementing the principles of Core Web Vitals should definitely be an integral part of your SEO strategy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It happens every day. People visit online stores, then abandon their carts before completing their purchase. The average rate of cart abandonment is around 75%. That means most ecommerce sites are losing around three quarters of their potential customers before they buy anything. So why do so many people shop and run? And what can you do to combat it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Unexpected costs. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the main reasons visitors leave without buying is unexpected costs. 25% of customers specifically cite shipping costs as the primary reason driving them away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution: The most obvious answer is to remove shipping costs. If that’s not feasible, make them transparent while the customer is browsing. You could also bundle the extra cost into the product cost itself, or let customers know they can bypass shipping fees if they meet a certain threshold. This can also increase Average Order Value.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Trust/payment security. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked to hand over their personal and financial information, many customers are rightly concerned about website security. Major causes for suspicion include design flaws, outdated layouts, missing trust logos and no SSL certificate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution: Show customers that their information is secure. Have a valid SSL certificate. Show trust symbols on your site such as well-known security logos (Verisign, PayPal Verified)</strong></p>
<p><strong>You could also use customer testimonials, product reviews, endorsements, and provide your full contact information.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Researching to buy later. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around 37% of abandoned carts are left by people who are just browsing.</p>
<p>Today, online shoppers use the internet for more than buying; they research products, brands, and deals.</p>
<p>Often, customers will add items to a cart in order to easily reference items with the intention of coming back. Many will return several times before making a purchase, perhaps on a different device or channel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution: Remarket to customers who abandon their shopping carts. If you don’t, you’re restricting yourself to just one shot at getting visitors to convert in a single session.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Having to create a new user account. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers expect convenience, want to do things quickly and have instant results. What they don’t want is to spend time and effort creating a new user account. 28% of all shoppers say this is why they’ve abandoned carts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution: Don’t force first time buyers to create an account before they can complete their order. Offer guest checkout, or better still, take them straight to guest checkout if they’re not logged in. Then you can display a text widget asking if they have an account. If not, simply begin the checkout process.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Long and confusing checkout. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As in point 4, long and confusing checkout processes are annoying to customers. Unnecessary forms only contribute to a poor experience, resulting in 28% of shoppers abandoning their carts. You should aim to limit the time and effort needed from them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution: Minimize form elements and only ask for necessary information. Streamline your site’s navigation and reducing the number of screens from initiation to completion. If your payment provider allows it, why not offer <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-pay/">Apple</a> or <a href="https://pay.google.com/gp/w/u/0/home/signup?sctid=6592541746681773">Google Pay</a> for one click purchases.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> Couldn&#8217;t find a coupon code.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers are hot on deals. If they can’t find a coupon or promotional code, they’ll look for one elsewhere. 8% of customers say not being able to find a coupon code is the primary reason for abandoning their cart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution: Set a coupon to automatically apply to the cart for your customers. Most carts have the ability to do this, and can be applied via emails or pop-ups.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong> No express shipping available.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nobody wants to have to wait for delivery. If you can’t deliver the goods in time, customers will abandon their carts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> <strong>Offer express shipping at checkout or bundle the extra cost into the product cost itself. Customers are more willing to spend more for expedited shipping. Or let customers know they can bypass shipping fees if they meet a certain threshold. This can also increase AOV.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong> Website had errors/crashes. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Website errors, crashes, and poor load times are no encouragement to complete a purchase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> <strong>Make regular checks on your site, right through from home page to checkout, ensuring that your site is still up to date and free of issues. Do these checks across a variety of screen sizes, especially mobile. You can also check your site speed through a free service like <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Google Pagespeed Insights</a>.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong> Returns policy wasn’t satisfactory. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It turns people off if you put time limits on your returns, or charge for them, maybe in the form of shipping. Up to 66% of shoppers say they’d spend more if there was a good returns policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> <strong>Track the number of returns and associated costs, then try offering free 30 day shipping. Run the test for a month or two and see what effect that has, compare this to the added costs and see if free 30 day return is a profitable strategy.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10: Lack of customer support. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers appreciate great service. A study found that 83% of online shoppers want help while on-site. Over half (51%) said they were more likely to make a purchase if they had customer support such as live chat during the session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> <strong>Try investing in live chat technology for a month or two and see if it improves customer shopping experience enough to have a measurable effect on sales.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other things you can do: </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The personal approach. </strong></p>
<p>When you get an abandoned cart, reach out and personally ask them if there’s anything you can do to help. You might discover they had a coupon code that didn’t work, a problem with getting a card authorized or some other question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Use cart abandonment emails. </strong></p>
<p>If it happens at the end of the checkout and you have their email address, email to notify them that they left items in their cart. Follow this up with 1 or 2 additional emails spread out over the next 24 hours.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>PPC stands for Pay Per Click. </strong><strong>Simply put, it’s a form of search engine advertising that allows you to buy visits to your website. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most popular <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/ppc/">PPC advertising</a> system is Google Ads. When you put your ad on Google Ads, every time someone clicks your ad, it sends them to your website, and you pay the search engine a fee. Google Ads helps you get your business found by your target audience who search for specific terms related to your brand, products and content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are the advantages of using PPC? </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s a quick and efficient way to make sure your message is getting in front of the right people at the right time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether you’re looking to drive more traffic to your site or get more sign ups for your newsletter, PPC advertising is an effective and proven way to invest your ad budget. And better still, you only pay for results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the most popular search engine, Google gets huge amounts of traffic and therefore delivers the most impressions and clicks to your ads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do you create a successful PPC campaign? </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to research and select the right keywords in your ads, then organize those keywords into well-organised campaigns and ad groups, and set up PPC landing pages that are optimized for conversions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Choosing the right keywords can be pretty complicated if you’re not a pro, but the <a href="https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/">Google Ads Keyword Planner</a> tool can help you research the longtail keywords your target audience are searching for, and use them to create your Google Ads campaigns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What else can PPC ads do?   </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They allow you to easily create compelling ads that deliver the messages and products/services your prospects are searching for. Not only that, with Google Ads for instance, you can easily set a budget and stay within it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also measure the effectiveness of your campaigns, see how many people are clicking on your ads, and the number of sales you’ve made. What’s more, you can test and amend your ads at any time, or pause and re-start them as and when you like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Right format, right audience, right budget. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PPC advertising works effectively in whatever format you choose, from text ads to image ads, mobile ads to video ads. With PPC you’re able to target your ads so they reach the people you’re aiming for. You’re even able to place your ads on websites related to your chosen topics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Google Ads, you can actually choose from a selection of pre-made ads, customise them to suit yourself, or build your own ads from scratch. Your bid amount is set automatically for you, ensuring your ad achieves the maximum number of clicks for the lowest cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As digital tech continues to grow and get ever smarter, AI is creating marketing trends that lean toward more authentic engagement, personal connections and relatable brand promotion. So here’s a bite-size rundown of the digital marketing trends we’re likely to see more of in 2021.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Shopping by post. </strong></p>
<p>Rather than direct customers from your Instagram account to your website, shoppable posts let them select and buy products direct from an app without having to navigate away from your posts. Instagram, Pinterest, and Facebook have all introduced ways for e-commerce stores to create shoppable posts. For online retailers, it’s a great way to drive traffic to product pages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Influencers get more personal. </strong></p>
<p>Rather than use ‘celebrities’ with lots of followers, companies now seek out <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/social-media-influencers-can-trust-be-bought/">influencers</a> with a smaller social media following to reach a more carefully targeted audience. Having a small but dedicated audience is more beneficial for marketing purposes than having a large but disconnected audience, and creates content that feels personal and authentic, because that’s what builds trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Video comes on-stream.  </strong></p>
<p>One in five videos on Facebook Live is now streamed, with similar features on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and Linkedin. Live videos on Facebook and Instagram are watched 3 times longer than non-live videos. 5G technology and advances in AI and voice tech will mean more personalisation and product placement within digital video as users interact with ads from connected TV and mobile devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>An interactive future. </strong></p>
<p>Interactive content will be one of 2021’s top marketing trends<strong>. </strong>Interactive content is any type of content such as calculators, quizzes, polls, surveys, contests, infographics and videos that encourage users to actively engage with your website rather than passively consume it. It’s a great way to add value for visitors, capture their engagement and learn more about them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Keeping it real. </strong></p>
<p>Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are both top marketing trends. In 2021, AR is expected to surpass VR in popularity. Already, many major companies are making use of AR, like Ikea’s ap that allows users to see what a piece of furniture would look like in their home before buying. With access to VR and AR technology, brands are offering tours of facilities and interactive 3D models so they can examine products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tech is listening.  </strong></p>
<p>Voice-activated digital assistants continue to be huge sellers. 72% of people with a voice-activated speaker say they often use it as part of their daily routine. More than just a voice that responds to your verbal requests to play a song or check the weather, this tech is communication between you and all your connected devices, so in 2021 expect to see more of it as the technology improves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tell me a story. </strong></p>
<p>Snapchat was first with these sharable 15 second glimpses of people’s lives. Then Instagram and Facebook got in on the act, and YouTube came up with a version called Reels. <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/introducing-fleets-new-way-to-join-the-conversation.html">Even Twitter</a> has done their own version! Instagram Stories have picked up 250 million users since launch in August 2016, and are used by 500 million people daily. Stories could become the next best way to share on social media.</p>

<p><strong>Websites go mobile. </strong></p>
<p>As more of us use smartphones and tablets for internet browsing, more websites are being created with a mobile-first design, with more features to deliver the best experience to mobile users. So we’ll see touchscreen-friendly navigation, streamlined navigation menus, less text-heavy content, and functions like collapsible menus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rise of the chatbots. </strong></p>
<p>Chatbots provide shoppers with personalized, accessible customer service, so have become an invaluable means of connecting with customers using the same kind of AI that’s found in voice search and smart assistants. They also help small and medium businesses offer a better experience by providing 24-hour service, vital information, and instant answers to customers’ questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Get the media message. </strong></p>
<p>Facebook Messenger has 1.3 billion active users every month, and around 10 billion messages are sent between people and businesses via the app. Social media messaging apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and WeChat combine the convenience of shopping from home, with the quick service that comes with face-to-face interaction, and are an inexpensive and easy way to improve customer experience.</p>
