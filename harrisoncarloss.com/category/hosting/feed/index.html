										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5>So what is web hosting?</h5>
<p>A web host allows your website to be viewed on the Internet. Your web host stores your website on a large-scale computer called a server. And when internet users want to view your website, they simply type your website address &#8211; your domain name &#8211; into their browser. Their computer then connects to the server, and your webpages are delivered to them through the browser.</p>
<h5>Simple. Except that it isn’t.</h5>
<p>There are lots of <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/website-hosting-support/">web hosting service</a> providers out there, and you should expect more from one than just getting your site on the internet. You need a host who‘ll keep your site well maintained. Keep it secure from potential hackers. Deal promptly with any technical issues that might arise. Know how to handle backups, malware and virus scanning. Fix broken links. Manage your domain names. And the rest.</p>
<h5>And what if your website went down?</h5>
