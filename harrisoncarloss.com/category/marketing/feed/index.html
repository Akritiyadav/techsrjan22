										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>In March of 2022, Disneyland Paris is set to launch what it bills as a </strong><strong>once-in-a-lifetime anniversary celebration.  </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After 30 years of dreams, the theme park announced its celebrations with a video on <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/services/marketing/social-media/">social media</a>, telling us the magic of Disneyland Paris will ignite like never before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The short video features old footage of the theme park, then at the end, Disneyland Paris showcases its anniversary logo of the number 30 that cleverly turns to reveal the famous Mickey Mouse ears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Magic as only Disney creates it. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To mark the occasion, as we might expect from the masterful creators of so many childhood and adult fantasies, Disney is promising “special experiences” across its Disneyland and Walt Disney Studios Park theme parks, as well as the rest of the resort, offering “a shining new era where guests will dream bigger, laugh louder and smile wider”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thirty years of fantastic fun.  </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was on April 12, 1992, that Disneyland® Paris officially welcomed guests for the first time after years of imagination, planning and development to bring Walt Disney’s magical dream to life in Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three decades later, the resort has continued to expand with new stories, characters and adventures, including beloved franchises such as Pixar, Star Wars and Marvel, becoming the number one tourist destination in Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goodbye Donald Duck, hello Captain America.  </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest additions to the resort include a brand new Marvel-themed hotel, inspired by a New York art gallery and packed with Marvel-themed artwork, as well as surprises including meet-and-greets with your favourite characters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disneyland Paris is also set to open a brand new Avengers Campus at its Walt Disney Studios Park, complete with a Spider-Man ride.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disneyland Paris cast members will be at the heart of the celebration, delivering the resort’s signature service and exceeding guests’ expectations each day by going above and beyond to make every visit special.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disneyland Paris isn’t the only one of the Disney Parks to be celebrating a special milestone in the coming months. Walt Disney World in Orlando is marking its 50th anniversary with 18 months of celebrations, beginning in October.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What a way to celebrate.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We love how this simple design that incorporates both the number 30 and a clever nod back to the origins of Disney with the Mickey Mouse ears. The results are an effective and impactful design that&#8217;s sure to go down in history as one of the best anniversary concepts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Q: What does it take to be a Paralympian? </strong></p>
<p><strong>A: There’s got to be something wrong with you.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Channel 4’s gritty Tokyo 2020 ‘Superhuman’ Paralympics campaign was genuinely stirring stuff from 4Creative, the channel’s in-house creative agency. It was based on the premise that to be a Paralympian, there’s got to be something wrong with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The implication was, of course, that you must be prepared for the blood, sweat, sacrifice and dedication demanded of a Paralympic athlete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A human approach.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for the 2020 games, rather than following in the same ‘super’ vein as previous Paralympian games campaigns, Channel 4 presented us with a more realistically human approach asking us to acknowledging just what these incredible athletes have to go through to compete at the games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We spotted an opportunity to present Paralympians in a way they hadn’t been shown before – by pointing a camera at the realities of their lives and, as with any elite athlete, the sacrifices they make in pursuit of greatness,” explained Lynsey Atkin, 4Creative’s exec creative director, on capturing the blood, sweat, sacrifices and dedication it takes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Olympians in the making.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Made by Oscar-nominated Bradford Young, and set to a freshly-recorded version of Bugsy Malone’s So You Want to Be a Boxer? by Jay Prince, the film candidly shows various British Paralympians preparing for Tokyo, including Ali Jawad, David Smith, Ellie Simmonds, Jody Cundy, Jordanne Whiley, Kadeena Cox and Kylie Grimes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the Olympics being postponed due to the pandemic, the ad had been in development for 18 months and was filmed in mid-May 2021 over a period of two weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure the ad was authentic, 4Creative worked closely with the athletes, who helped to write the script. “Everything you see in the film was inspired by real-life experiences of the Paralympians featured, all of whom generously shared their stories with us,” said Lynsey Atkins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As well as working closely with British Paralympians, 4Creative also liaised with the International Paralympic Committee, the British Paralympics Association and Scope, all of whom provided invaluable insight and guidance in shaping the campaign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>It’s not rude to stare.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Channel 4’s outdoor and print campaign followed the same vein, turning the social stigma of ‘not staring’ into something positive, with ads proclaiming ‘It’s rude not to stare’, along with ‘like the Olympic 800m, but faster’, and ‘Sub 2hr marathons? We do those sitting down’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was all great stuff, using superbly garish colours, together with copy that was both clever and provocative. The kind of work you wish you’d done yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However you look at it, this is a wonderful campaign that focused brilliantly on the fact that being a Paralympian is more about mental determination than disability. Heroic and uplifting, you can’t help but be inspired by these super humans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is a Google Partner agency?  </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Google Partner agency is a recognised expert at handling digital <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/services/marketing/">marketing</a> for its clients by using Google Ads to promote a business’s products and services on Google Search, YouTube, and other sites across the web. The Google Partner badge is awarded to agencies who have the latest Google Ads expertise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ok, so what is Google Ads?  </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google Ads is a Google program that uses <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/ppc/">pay-per-click (PPC) advertising</a> &#8211; paid ads that appear in Google search engine results. Google Ads are proven to be a highly effective means of reaching your target audience, and can be one of the most profitable ways to get new leads and conversions for your business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are the benefits of using a Google Partner agency? </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only companies with proven expertise in Google Ads can become a Google Partner, which means they’ve passed Google Ads product certification exams, manage a minimum account spend and have the latest product information. Partners are also able to attend advanced training sessions to keep abreast of PPC best practices, so when you choose a Partner agency, you’ll know they are keeping up with PPC strategies as they evolve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What does Google ads product certification mean? </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Google Partner can be certified in numerous types of Google ads, including search, mobile, video, shopping, and display advertising, and have staff who are highly trained to work with Google Ads. With these expert qualifications, a Google Partner will be able to create a more effective campaign for your budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Google Partners work with the latest PPC information. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The digital world is constantly evolving and changing, so it’s vital to stay on top of these changes to make the most of your digital marketing plan. That’s why Google requires their Partners to take recertification exams to ensure that they stay up to speed with the latest changes. By choosing a Google Partner agency, you’re benefiting from all of the most up-to-date changes with Google Ads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Google Partners have access to beta features. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google has numerous new and innovative features that they test before the public gets access to them &#8211; typically the latest updates to the Google Ads system. So obviously, when you work with a Google Partner agency, you get the benefits of these beta features when your agency integrates them into your plan, all helping to keep you competitive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Google Partners work directly with Google. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another big advantage when using a Google Partner is that as your PPC ads are run through Google’s platform, one of the top search engine platforms, Google Partners work directly with Google, who provides Partners with their own team. So they can speak to Google directly for account and technical support, or to address any problems that might arise.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>We recently achieved Google Partner status. Why not <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/contact/">get in touch</a> to see how we can use our Google expertise to help you?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>As we come to the end of restrictions, Uncommon Creative Studio created a campaign for Google centred around the Google search bar. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Josh Tenser, creative director at <a href="https://www.uncommon.london/">Uncommon</a>, the brief was to drive meaning and emotion back into an incredible brand with perhaps the most important product on the planet &#8211; because people have started to take the magic of what <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google Search</a> can do for granted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So at the start of the ad we’re told that there are 68 million people in the UK, and we’re all searching for something. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As searching is what Google is all about, one simple question after another is entered in the search bar &#8211; included such things as ‘What is reopening anxiety?’, ‘How to remember dad’, ‘Can we hug now?’ and ‘Is kissing safe?’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What we’ve been missing. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We see a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEfhyYJgcZ4">series of poignant moments</a> of joy or loss, anxiety, hope and happiness; cameos of normal, everyday life to remind us of things the British public have been missing during the pandemic. The whole thing is held together by a kaleidoscopic backing of UK dance music and ambient SFX.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Making ads for over a year in the pandemic has tuned us in really tightly to the pressure points in the collective psyche,” said Tenser, “and this was the well we drew from &#8211; everything we have learned in the past year.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Real life searches.  </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that once they had the narrative they wanted, they gave the script &#8211; in essence a sequence of search queries &#8211; to Google’s data insight team. They then cross-referenced what had been written with the most realistic possible live searches, adjusting the script to make it true to what people would actually type into the search bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A mirror of life. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Said Tenser, “Google isn’t just for the small transactions like banana bread recipes and directions to dry cleaners. We often search for the big stuff, too. It was very much intended to be a mirror up to U.K. life, U.K. people. Something that smelled like us &#8211; and only us &#8211; right now.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nils Leonard, co-founder, Uncommon Creative Studio added: “Trivial terms tell the story of our hopes and unknowns, the smallest search can mean everything. We find each other there. Uncommon are proud to bring the Google brand story to the UK as we all enter the Summer of our lives.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The campaign premiered Tuesday June 1 during Channel 4’s ‘Great British Bake Off: The Professionals’, going on to cover all channels, accompanied by digital &amp; poster OOH across iconic locations in the UK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Searching for more.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google has really tugged on heartstrings with the latest campaign and it&#8217;s clear to see the impact of the use of data to create authenticity. In a time where we&#8217;re looking to move on from Covid-19 restrictions, they&#8217;ve really managed to embrace the mood of the nation &#8211; both the good and the bad &#8211; to create an ad that exudes optimism in the time when it&#8217;s needed most.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Try €10,000. That’s how much Irish bookmaker Paddy Power has <a href="https://news.paddypower.com/football/2021/06/06/save-our-game-paddy-power-england-euro-2020-10k-every-goal/">pledged to donate to Irish Football</a> for every goal England scores in the tournament, in a new campaign named ‘#SaveOurGame’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Donations will be doubled to €20,000 if either of the England side’s two Irish players, Jack Grealish or Declan Rice, succeed in scoring for England in a pledge called ‘The Back Stabber’ bonus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The campaign hopes to bring English and Irish football fans to put their stormy past aside for the tournament and come together in appreciation of a cordial win-win situation that should have both cheering in support of a common sporting cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then again, the fact that the Republic of Ireland squad failed to qualify for the tournament could have something to do with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The campaign kicked off with a full-page ad in The Irish Times under the headline “Come on you boys in white!” showing an Ireland player’s shirt being ripped open to reveal a red England flag on the player’s chest. This was accompanied by the installation of an outsize 100 x 56m St. George’s Cross on the Bray Wanderers Ground in County Wicklow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Irish pundit and former Ireland international Eamon Dunphy, and former Crystal Palace and Hull City star Damien Delaney, who were both on hand to add encouragement to Irish fans, both appear in a tongue-in-cheek video, with a cameo from Paddy Power himself, to launch the #SaveOurGame campaign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Said a Paddy Power spokesperson, “Irish football fans are the best in the world, and we know they would do anything for the good of the game. We’re not asking them to pledge their allegiance to the Queen. We haven’t totally lost the plot. But for the duration of the Euros, for every goal England score is money in the bank for Irish football.” He added, “We want to give Irish fans a reason to cheer this summer &#8211; even if it slips out accidentally!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paddy Power are well known for their daring marketing; in their past campaigns they&#8217;ve pushed boundaries and even got them in hot water for <a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/paddy-power-pistorius-ad-brings-advertising-into-disrepute/">some particularly bad taste ads</a>. But we love this bold move from the team &#8211; and while we don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll get Irish fans singing Three Lions anytime soon &#8211; it proves that an England goal isn&#8217;t always bad news, especially not for grassroots Irish football.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>It’s a simple fact that when things are designed better, they work better. This is true not just for the design of products, but for the graphic design we use to represent and promote them. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great design works not only on a conscious level, but on a subliminal level. It influences how we feel about things and what they mean to us. But in today’s overcrowded marketplace only the very best designs stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Great design sells itself. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/">Apple</a> is one of the best examples. From the design of the <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/services/creative/#Branding">branding</a>, through to the design of Apple’s products themselves, you get a strong and consistent message and a lasting impression that says this is how good things should look, and how well they should work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Great design makes you stand out. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We buy what we like the look of. The same goes for graphics. A strong visual design can jump off the page and make your business look more credible and reliable. Great design also says authenticity and bolsters your reputation by underlining your strategy and messaging. Great design reflects and reinforces your business ethos and purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Great design works hard online. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visual appeal strongly influences online behaviour. If a potential customer finds your website unattractive or hard to navigate, chances are you’ll lose them. That’s why you must have a beautifully designed site that makes the most effective use of colour, imagery, white space and graphics to guide a consumer to key information such as available and relevant products/services and prices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Great design creates the best first impression. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, it takes only about 50 milliseconds for potential customers to form an opinion on your website, so that first impression really counts. They set the tone for the rest of your business relationship. A good <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/services/creative/#Graphic-Design">graphic designer</a> will create consistent, credible and memorable design for your brand across all visual media.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Great design speaks a thousand words. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great graphic design can push boundaries with boldly innovative visual ideas that communicate with an audience instantly, below the level of thought. The best graphic design has the power to future-proof a brand by creating and combining visual elements in ways that are as distinctive online as they are on the printed page. All of which is why great design can work wonders for your bottom line.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>BBC tear up and set fire to their own billboards to mimic what we’re doing to the planet. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>In the BBC series <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08xc2lh">A Perfect Planet</a>, Sir David Attenborough tells us that oceans, sunlight, weather and volcanoes are powerful yet fragile forces that together allow life to flourish in astonishing diversity. They make Earth truly unique &#8211; a perfect planet, teeming with life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November, the team at <a href="https://www.bbccreative.co.uk/">BBC Creative</a> joined with <a href="https://talonoutdoor.com/">Talon Outdoor</a> to begin promoting the series through a number of posters erected across the UK displaying shots of our miraculous world and its extraordinary inhabitants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BBC Creative also created a lengthy trailer covering the series &#8211; oceans, volcano, the sun, humans and weather.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the final episode of the series, Attenborough warns us that our ‘Perfect Planet’ is a fragile system, and today there’s a new force. One so powerful it threatens life on Earth. Human activity is now so dominant that it’s disrupting the forces of nature, and the vital habitats that life needs to survive on Earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the show drew to a close, BBC Creative used its own billboards to demonstrate how humans are a destructive force on the planet in a bigger campaign focusing on the climate change crisis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one site they tore fragments of the billboard away to reveal the remnants of hard-hitting imagery behind. In another site the billboard has been designed to make it look like it has been set on fire to boldly illustrate that wildfire destroys habitats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>James Cross, creative director at BBC Creative, said the campaign had to shock. “It needs to highlight the fact that BBC nature series aren’t all about the good stuff, the wow and the wonder. There is actually a serious message that in more recent times, the corporation is leaning towards.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He added that the PR value in doing an execution good enough to be talked about and shared online far outweighs any installation costs. It’s already had way more column inches than the average TV commercial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All well and good, but it’ll take a great deal more than a few cleverly manipulated billboards to halt what is already a very real climate crisis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Sir David himself makes clear in the series, “To preserve our planet, we need to act now. And if we do that, there will still be time to restore the ecological balance that once made this Earth our perfect planet.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>PPC stands for Pay Per Click. </strong><strong>Simply put, it’s a form of search engine advertising that allows you to buy visits to your website. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most popular <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/ppc/">PPC advertising</a> system is Google Ads. When you put your ad on Google Ads, every time someone clicks your ad, it sends them to your website, and you pay the search engine a fee. Google Ads helps you get your business found by your target audience who search for specific terms related to your brand, products and content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are the advantages of using PPC? </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s a quick and efficient way to make sure your message is getting in front of the right people at the right time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether you’re looking to drive more traffic to your site or get more sign ups for your newsletter, PPC advertising is an effective and proven way to invest your ad budget. And better still, you only pay for results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the most popular search engine, Google gets huge amounts of traffic and therefore delivers the most impressions and clicks to your ads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do you create a successful PPC campaign? </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to research and select the right keywords in your ads, then organize those keywords into well-organised campaigns and ad groups, and set up PPC landing pages that are optimized for conversions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Choosing the right keywords can be pretty complicated if you’re not a pro, but the <a href="https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/">Google Ads Keyword Planner</a> tool can help you research the longtail keywords your target audience are searching for, and use them to create your Google Ads campaigns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What else can PPC ads do?   </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They allow you to easily create compelling ads that deliver the messages and products/services your prospects are searching for. Not only that, with Google Ads for instance, you can easily set a budget and stay within it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also measure the effectiveness of your campaigns, see how many people are clicking on your ads, and the number of sales you’ve made. What’s more, you can test and amend your ads at any time, or pause and re-start them as and when you like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Right format, right audience, right budget. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PPC advertising works effectively in whatever format you choose, from text ads to image ads, mobile ads to video ads. With PPC you’re able to target your ads so they reach the people you’re aiming for. You’re even able to place your ads on websites related to your chosen topics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Google Ads, you can actually choose from a selection of pre-made ads, customise them to suit yourself, or build your own ads from scratch. Your bid amount is set automatically for you, ensuring your ad achieves the maximum number of clicks for the lowest cost.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Direct mail? Are we serious? In the digital age! </strong><strong>You’d better believe it. </strong><strong>Digital may have all of the latest fancy bells and whistles, but direct mail has too many advantages to ignore. And in some significant ways, it beats digital hands down. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>33% percent of people find <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/services/print/#Direct-Mail">direct mail</a> the most effective way to remember a product. <a href="https://mosaic.buzz/direct-mail-is-not-dead-here-is-why-it-is-thriving/#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%2079%25%20of%20consumers,offer%20right%20in%20their%20hands.">79% of consumers</a> are known to act on direct mail immediately. 73% of direct mail recipients can’t wait to get their hands on what’s in their mailbox. And direct mail can often be more cost-effective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Direct mail gets your business directly into your customers’ home. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your message lands right there in your customer’s mailbox, so it feels more personal. As if someone took the trouble to mail it, rather than shooting off a load of emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Direct mail also feels better. It has a tactile, tangible crispness that recipients just don’t get when they’re bombarded with emails or ads on social media. And they can read it whenever they want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What else does print have that’s unique?  </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Backed up by intelligent <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/services/creative/">creative</a> ideas, a piece of printed direct mail can create more positive feelings towards a brand, and achieve more brand recall than upstart digital trickery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Studies show that millennials who spend more time with a physical piece of print in their hands have a stronger emotional response, so they’re more likely to remember it. It’s also well worth bearing in mind that if you’re aiming to reach an older audience, more than 40% of over 65s still don’t use the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Printed mail is easier to read. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s not only an older audience who’d rather receive a mailer they can hold in their hand. Most people would prefer to get your marketing message that way. In one survey 81% of people said they’d rather read a piece of printed mail than a version on a screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research shows that when you add a personalised message, your printed mailing will be remembered long after its momentary online counterpart has gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s more, people are more inclined to trust a piece of printed material than a message that sprang up on their screen unbidden.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Print and digital work well together. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The smart strategy is to use print and <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/services/digital/">digital</a> to complement each other. A first push with a clever printed mailshot whose message is subsequently repeated digitally and via social media can give your brand extra credibility That way you can reach potential customers both on- and offline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One last thought: The internet is overflowing with marketing messages. Mailboxes aren’t.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Disorientated by direct mail?</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>He was the Abbott in Abbott Mead Vickers, considered the greatest copywriter of his generation.</p>
<p>In those days all the best London ad agencies were running long copy ads &#8211; and I mean l-o-o-o-n-g copy, as in a full page broadsheet filled with columns of type.</p>
<p>Ads like those were a kind of commercial storytelling, and boy, did some of them ramble on.</p>
<p>But marketing’s evolved exponentially since those days. It’s a very different animal now.</p>
<p>The business of brand promotion has become a whole other story in a world that moves a lot faster, where everything’s available and we all want it now.</p>
<p>It means today’s breed of copy has to run to keep up. It also has to change shape and tone, and adapt to fit an ever changing range of new media.</p>
<p>Long copy still has a role &#8211; in the right context &#8211; yet even then you’ll be lucky if your headline gets read. And that could be the only thing that is read if it doesn’t grab your audience by the proverbials and make them read the copy.</p>
<p>Whatever the context or the medium, a good headline traditionally had just one purpose – to get people to read the first line of the body copy. And that first line’s job was to make them read the line after it, and so on, right down to your call to action.</p>
<p>These days, copy needs to work effectively across a broad spectrum of media. It must cut through the cacophony of messages and make your brand unmissable.</p>
<p>If you’ve read this far, why not <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/contact/">get in touch</a> and allow us to show you what effective <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/services/creative/#Copywriting">copy</a> &#8211; and design &#8211; can do for your project?</p>
