										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Harrison Carloss, the Staffordshire based strategic marketing and creative </strong><strong>agency that first opened its doors in 1972, this year celebrates its 50th year in business.  </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>As Staffordshire’s oldest established and longest running agency with 50 years of creative triumphs behind them and a heap of awards and achievements, Harrison Carloss has made a name for itself in the industry working with a huge mix of clients on a string of highly successful campaigns for global, national and regional brands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a complete rebrand 3 years ago, the agency has seen a considerable transformation, bolstering its in-house capabilities in the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then, they have experienced huge growth and continued to build on their solid foundation in strategic marketing, enhancing their digital, web design and web development offering. In the process they have produced outstanding work for clients to further build on a long reputation as a leading creative agency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among more recent successes the agency has been recommended for no less than 35 services on <a href="https://www.recommendedagencies.com/harrison-carloss">The Drum Recommends</a> and have received 8 The Drum digital, marketing and advertising award nominations and 4 Prolific North award nominations. In addition, the agency featured in The Northern Agency Guide 2021 for the second year running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The agency also achieved the <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/why-you-should-work-with-a-google-partner-agency/">Google Partner</a> accolade, all thanks to the hard work and dedication of several members of the HC team strengthening their digital capabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commenting on the agency’s golden anniversary, Adam Mobley, Harrison Carloss’ Managing Director, said: “50 years old! Even we can hardly believe it. When Mike and John set the agency up, there was no internet, no computers, no emails, no smartphones. It makes you wonder how the agency got anything done!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“It’s something of an achievement for an agency to still be independently owned at 50 years old. We’re obviously doing all the right things. Just in the last year, the close and passionate collaboration of our account and creative teams has seen us enjoy sustained growth with a number of significant client wins. We also increased our retainer revenues significantly.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“Our strength is a fearless creative drive, an enviable wealth of marketing expertise, and a commitment to produce outstanding and thought-provoking work for our clients.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“Naturally, we have a few anniversary-marking activities planned but we’re keeping those under wraps for now. This year is a huge achievement and celebration for us and we’re looking forward to our continuing growth and success.”</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The celebrations are continuing over on our social media!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5>Harrison Carloss, the strategic marketing agency famed for its marketing know-how and creative output, has hired two new team members and promoted a third to swell the agency’s prodigious all-round skill set following sustained growth.</h5>
<p>Tayler adds her considerable abilities as a Creative Designer, Selina strengthens our brilliant client services line-up, and Molly receives a well-deserved promotion to Account Manager.</p>
<p>After completing her degree, a stint in marketing told <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/team/tayler-nuttall/">Tayler</a> the fast-paced agency life was for her. She became concept lead with a marketing and design agency, developing her design talents on both print and digital including brand development and web design.</p>
<p>As a highly capable Account Executive with experience in busy B2B and third sector agencies, Selina’s passion is working with people and adding value to everything she does. Outside of work, <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/team/selina-talbot/">Selina</a> is currently also studying a BSc (Hons) in Business and Management with Derby University.</p>
<p>In moving up from Account Executive to Account Manager, <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/team/molly/">Molly</a> brings her considerable SEO and client liaison experience to the new role, and will now have the opportunity to use her already highly proficient project management and marketing abilities to develop clients’ digital strategies further.</p>
<p>Molly, Selina and Tayler will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to the agency, helping to further round out our in-house capabilities, besides augmenting an already impressive team of creative, web and digital capabilities, designers, developers, inventors, strategists, artists and storytellers.</p>
<p>Harrison Carloss’ Managing Director Adam Mobley commented:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“It’s always a real pleasure to have talented and highly motivated people join us whilst also recognising our existing team, especially as with their help I know we can continue to deliver the very best for our existing and new clients. The past year has already seen us enjoy sustained growth with a number of significant client wins after we weathered the storm of the last couple of years, we are now looking forward to the future of Harrison Carloss. The business will also be turning 50 this year so for all of us this is going to be the beginning of yet another exciting chapter for the agency.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>We’re an innovative and creative gang, passionate about launching and growing brands. Check out our <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/jobs/">vacancies</a> page for the latest roles at Harrison Carloss.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>12 months. 365 days. 1 lockdown (so far). Maybe it wasn&#8217;t the year we were expecting but throughout 2021 we&#8217;ve been doing some pretty damn amazing work.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We designed and produced 1,053,765 pieces of printed collateral. Our talented dev team wrote 258,553 lines of code. Our account management team sent a whopping 34,743 emails. We scheduled 2184 social media posts. Wrote 132 monthly plans and much more. All in a year&#8217;s work for Harrison Carloss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do hope you’ve enjoyed a good 2021 too. Here’s a brief recap on what’s been going on for us over the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So where do we begin?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Let’s jump straight into the Harrison Carloss Customer Portal. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We launched our smart portal back in August to make it super easy for clients to access useful information about their account. The portal allows clients to manage their websites, warranties, check their marketing reports, Google Analytics, and get general support, all in one convenient, one-stop place. They can also access monthly website updates, Google Analytics data, marketing metrics &#8211; it’s all there at their fingertips. Neat, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Meet Tayler and Selina, our latest staff additions. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tayler is a <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/team/tayler-nuttall/">Creative Designer</a> who reckons all the best designers are geeks &#8211; her included &#8211; admitting she couldn’t imagine doing anything but design. Well, maybe a professional pizza taster. Selina, <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/team/selina-talbot/">one of our Account Execs</a>, is another geek, in her case it’s for marketing and people, and she combines the two at Harrison Carloss. She describes herself as a problem solver, marketing idea generator, innovator and professional juggler.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Awards nominations? 9 at the last count.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve actually been nominated for 9 awards in The Drum Recommends Digital Awards, The Drum Recommends Marketing &amp; Advertising Awards, and the Prolific North Awards. We might also mention that, in addition, we’ve featured in The Northern Agency Guide 2021 for the second year running. There’s no escaping the fact that a lot of people love the way we work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>And then there’s our Google Partner status.  </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We achieved the <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/why-you-should-work-with-a-google-partner-agency/">Google Partner</a> accolade all thanks to the hard work and dedication of several members of the HC team who gained their qualifications for successfully managing and improving our clients’ Google Ad accounts. It means that we demonstrated Google Ads skill and expertise, met Google ad spend requirements, delivered company, agency and client revenue growth, and sustained and grown our client base.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Yes, a pretty busy year all round. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now we’d just like to say a great big thank you to all of our lovely clients. We couldn’t have done it without you. Now we’re looking forward to an even busier 2022.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And while we’re on the subject of next year, there’s one more thing&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We’re going for Gold! </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’ll never guess what, so we’ll open up. 2022 marks the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the day we at Harrison Carloss first opened our doors for business. Imagine! 50 golden years in business! Who said congratulations are in order? Naturally we have a few anniversary-marking things planned but we’re keeping those under wraps until the big reveal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See you all for another exciting year in 2022!</p>

This has allowed us to create a group of collaborative businesses, bringing together ideas, experience and technology to disrupt markets and help each business deliver on its true potential.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Harrison Carloss, the strategic creative agency with over 40 years of successful marketing know-how to its name, has boosted its digital and creative design team with the addition of some fresh new talent.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chelsea joins the agency as a front end developer, while Chris brings with him digital design skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a year’s web design at one of the UK&amp;I’s largest technology distribution and specialist service providers, <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/team/chelsea-colclough/">Chelsea</a> was lead digital designer at Staffordshire University. She then spent 18 months as a front end web developer working on websites, SEO, DMS, lead management and online sales software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

He then did design work on yachts in Falmouth, and subsequently worked in a design and project management role in the Midlands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are very pleased to say that the agency has weathered the Covid-19 storm remarkably well and, true to form, we have been supporting clients and businesses with a a full range of marketing services which include <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/website-design-and-development/">web design</a>, branding and marketing strategy, direct mail, advertising, design for print and print management.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>You thought Christmas was starting earlier every year, right? Well this looks like being one year when it can’t come soon enough.</strong></p>
<p>After the multitude of miseries brought about by Coronavirus, Christmas is proving to be more important than ever to over half of UK adults this time around. A survey by <a href="https://kineticww.com/uk/">Kinetic Worldwide</a> research shows that we’re already hitting the stores in anticipation.</p>
<p>28% of us have begun the Christmas shopping rush, 58% have expressed an intention not to hold back on what we spend, and 16% of us are planning to spend more than we would usually.</p>
<p><strong>Shopping online lacks the jingle.</strong></p>
<p>This is despite an increase in online shopping, though a spike in lockdown online spending may prove to be short-lived, as Kinetic’s survey indicated that just 31% of us will spend more online compared to the pre-pandemic norm. By contrast, 56% of adults go out of their way to shop in-store wherever possible, while 63% of 18-34-year-olds report missing the outdoor shopping experience.</p>
<p><strong>Stocking up for the festivities.</strong></p>
<p>None of us need reminding that Christmas presents us with a great incentive to go a bit mad, sure. But this time the worsening pandemic has given everyone the perfect excuse to embrace the festivities extra early. 25% of us are expected to mount our seasonal raid on the shops before we even get Halloween out of the way.</p>
<p>Lockdown notwithstanding, shoppers in Greater Manchester and parts of Lancashire aren’t deterred; footfall has dropped just 1-2% since the ’rule of six’ was imposed. And though we’d naturally expect to see a surge in online shopping thanks to the virus, 37% of us plan to do our Christmas shopping in store the traditional way.</p>
<p><strong>Christmas is more real in-store.</strong></p>
<p>So it would appear that even the perils of a pandemic won’t stop the die-hards. Covid-19 hotspots in Wales saw footfall increase by 1-2%, while In areas such as Caerphilly, Glamorgan, footfall rebounded 5% week-on-week despite the imposition of even stricter restrictions.</p>
<p>Nor were 80% of in-store shoppers put off by the minor inconvenience of having to wear a face mask, and only 21% were reducing the time they spent on the high street as a result.</p>
<p><strong>So this year’s Christmas message is clear.</strong></p>
<p>Despite limits on social gatherings, the numbers of family we can see &#8211; if any &#8211; and the watered-down spirit of our traditional Christmas parties, all the signs say we’re determined not to let Covid put the humbug on our Christmas!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most recognisable and successful US ad campaigns &#8211; for <a href="https://oldspice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Old Spice</a> &#8211; features a guy with a towel wrapped round his waist stepping out of the shower with a bottle of body wash (you know the one ladies <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />). Now, <a href="https://www.papajohns.co.uk/">Papa John’s</a> have reinvented the famous ad for their new spicy pizza flavours.</p>
<p>“Hello ladies,” he says to us. “Look at your man. Now back to me. Now back at your man. Now back to me. Sadly, he isn’t me. But if he stopped using lady-scented body wash and switched to Old Spice, he could smell like he’s me.”</p>
<p>This is actor and former pro football player Isaiah Mustafa, exhorting guys to swap their girlie smelling body wash for Old Spice so they can “smell like a man, man.” Later we see him on a white stallion and shirtless. “I’m on a horse,” he tells us enigmatically.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the pizza connection.</p>
<p>It’s all in the word ‘spice’. Papa John’s pizza have spoofed those famous Old Spice ads to launch their new range of spicy pizzas. Only instead of Isaiah and his Old Spice body wash, we have Love Island winner Luke Trotman launching the pizza campaign to his 1.5m Instagram followers.</p>
<p>As the ‘New Spice Guy’ in a tongue-in-cheek approach that loosely parodies the Old Spice campaign, we see Luke on a very minimal set. There’s a manky looking pizza on a plinth beside him. “Hello ladies,” he says. “Hello gentlemen. Look at your pizza. Now look at this. (The manky pizza) “Woah!” he says. “That spice is old. Time to turn up the heat.”</p>
<p>Papa John’s tongue in cheek reinvention of this old classic has been brought into the modern era by using an ‘Instagram Famous’ reality star, tapping into Luke’s connections and fans to promote their new range of pizzas to their target demographic – with a little bit of humour thrown in for good measure of course.</p>
<p>After a few important messages about the meat or veggie options, we then see Luke, cocktail in one hand, pizza in the other, seated not on a white stallion but a dopey looking fake camel. Luke bites into the pizza. ‘Spicy’ says the caption.</p>
<p>Marketing Director at Papa John&#8217;s, Giles Codd, said: &#8220;From the long-awaited return of our Bee Sting pizza to the new Chilli Freak, we&#8217;ve really hiked up the heat this summer and we can&#8217;t wait for our customers to try these new flavours!</p>
<p>&#8220;With everything that&#8217;s going on in the world right now we wanted to add some light-hearted, make you smile moments to the launch and we&#8217;re sure this will do just that.&#8221;</p>
<p>It just goes to show sometimes an oldie but a goldie is exactly what you need.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, not really… <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/team/adam-mobley/">Adam</a> has been the MD of Harrison Carloss for a while now, but we have officially separated from <a href="http://myclevergroup.com/">My Clever Group</a>. It’s been an amazing 18 months as part of the Group but it’s time we flew the nest.</p>
<p>We’ve achieved such a lot in such a short space of time; we fully rebranded to Harrison Carloss, <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/harrison-carloss-takes-on-yet-more-top-talent/">gained new team members</a>, put in a huge amount of time and effort to enhance our digital, web design and web development services, produced some outstanding work for clients to build on our long reputation as a leading creative agency, and, most importantly, we gained some lovely new clients along the way.</p>
<p>“It’s been fantastic seeing Harrison Carloss go from strength to strength over the last 18 months,” he said, “Knowing that I’ve played a central role in that journey along with the team. With a background in design and technology, it’s something that I’m personally passionate about.”</p>
<p>At the time of Adam’s management buyout, we had already grown our portfolio of clients significantly under his leadership and direction, working with a number of well-known businesses both locally and nationwide since our rebrand. Adam will now continue in his role as Managing Director, taking on full commercial responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the business.</p>
<p>Gareth also commented: “I’m a huge believer in the power of marketing. It was undoubtedly a significant factor in helping us to build my previous business, <a href="https://www.solidor.co.uk/">Solidor</a> into the high growth, well-known business that it was then and still is to this day. The team at Harrison Carloss, led by Adam, have already achieved such a lot in a short amount of time, and I’ll continue to support the business with its plans for growth.”</p>
<h6>So what’s next for Staffordshire’s longest running creative marketing agency?</h6>
<p>Says Adam, “I’m now looking forward to building on the agency’s past successes and continuing to push the business forward, to deliver the very best for clients, both existing and new, in the future.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Facebook and Google have both launched free shopping product listings. Not only will this help to rebuild the economy while the Covid-19 pandemic continues, it will help a lot of small businesses get online for the first time.</h4>
<h6>Free product shopping listings from Google:</h6>
<p>Now, instead of having to pay for product listings on Google’s Shopping tab, all online retailers will be able to <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/shopping/its-now-free-to-sell-on-google/">list their wares for free</a>. This means most search results on the Google Shopping tab will be free listings, helping merchants better connect with consumers, regardless of whether they advertise on Google.</p>
<p>While Google have been planning to do this for some time, the Covid-19 pandemic has been a major factor in making this happen now.</p>
<p>Google’s main search page won’t change. There’ll still be paid shopping ads on the same page as the free Google Shopping listings, so advertisers wanting prominence in the search results and to show more products, will continue to pay for ads.</p>
<h6>No-fee shopping from Facebook and Instagram:</h6>
<p>Similarly, with the Facebook and Instagram Shops, businesses in the UK and around the world can now <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/introducing-facebook-shops/">sell their products through in-app stores on Facebook and Instagram</a> without having to pay a fee. The stores will appear on business pages, Instagram profiles and through targeted ads.</p>
<p>Facebook say their Facebook Shops rollout has also been in the pipeline for at least half a year, with the initial stage of the plan being brought forward and extended because of Covid-19. Now they want businesses whatever their size to benefit during this difficult time.</p>
<p>Eventually Facebook’s fee-free shopping will also appear on WhatsApp and Facebook’s other messaging apps where it will integrate with live streams. So when someone decides they want to buy something, they’ll be directed to the company&#8217;s website to do it. If they have questions, they can simply use Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, or Instagram Direct messages.</p>
<h6>There’s never been a better time to connect with your customers</h6>
<p>There’s no doubt the lockdown has worked in both Google and Facebook’s favour. It’s also clear that free listings will certainly drive more advertising and have a considerable impact on shoppers and advertisers.</p>
<p>Both approaches will be continually modified during the coming months. Google have promised to streamline the onboarding process over the coming weeks and months to include a new partnership with PayPal, allowing merchants to link their accounts.</p>
<p>Google also pledged to continue working closely with their eCommerce partners, like WooCommerce, Magento and Shopify, to help merchants manage their products and inventory better, and to make digital commerce more accessible for businesses of all sizes.</p>
<p>Facebook plans a wider range of shopping changes across Facebook&#8217;s products, including with a loyalty scheme linking things such as points from local coffee shops to Facebook, and a Shop button to showcase products and brands on Instagram&#8217;s main navigation bar.</p>
<p>Show us you care by subscribing to our <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/#popup">newsletter</a> and get the latest marketing news and insights from our blog directly into your inbox.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>It’s been a strange few weeks here at Harrison Carloss HQ (and by that we mean our respective homes), so it was really welcomed when we got the incredibly exciting news that we had been shortlisted for <a href="https://www.recommendedawards.com/">The Drum Recommends Awards 2020</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unlike other awards, The Drum Recommends is based solely on <a href="https://www.recommendedagencies.com/harrison-carloss/?">reviews</a> from our lovely, real-life clients, so this really means a lot to us!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>What is The Drum?</h6>
<p>The Drum is Europe’s largest media and marketing website, attracting over 1.4 million unique users and over 200,00 social followers each month. They pride themselves on helping businesses make informed decisions about their marketing and showcasing the best of the best.</p>
<p>The Drum Recommends Awards is a highlight for a number of agencies. Differing from other awards, they are based entirely on the ratings and reviews of an agency’s clients which are collected on The Drum’s <a href="https://www.recommendedagencies.com/">Recommended Agencies</a> website – no entries to submit or papers to write!</p>
<p>The award covers a number of discipline and service categories – we have been nominated for our vibrant and powerful print! We have worked on a number of exciting print projects over the last year that have really allowed us to test our creative muscles. From design to distribution, Harrison Carloss have always been at the forefront of <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/services/print/">print</a>, so to get this recognition means so much to the team. Who said print is dead? Not us!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Party in our PJs!</h6>
<p>We’re incredibly proud of the whole team, as well as the amazing clients we’ve worked with who have allowed us to showcase our talents, and have a lot of fun doing it! The winners will be announced at the end of April – without the opportunity for Harrison Carloss outing, unfortunately! Nonetheless, we are excited to find out whether we have an excuse to crack open the fancy isolation drinks we’ve been saving.</p>
<p>For more information about our award nominated work, <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/contact/">get in touch</a> with the team and see how we can help your business. Or sign up to our newsletter, <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/#popup">The Carloss Chronicle</a>, for the latest news, insights and more from the team.</p>
