										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5>Harrison Carloss, the strategic marketing agency famed for its marketing know-how and creative output, has hired two new team members and promoted a third to swell the agency’s prodigious all-round skill set following sustained growth.</h5>
<p>Tayler adds her considerable abilities as a Creative Designer, Selina strengthens our brilliant client services line-up, and Molly receives a well-deserved promotion to Account Manager.</p>
<p>After completing her degree, a stint in marketing told <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/team/tayler-nuttall/">Tayler</a> the fast-paced agency life was for her. She became concept lead with a marketing and design agency, developing her design talents on both print and digital including brand development and web design.</p>
<p>As a highly capable Account Executive with experience in busy B2B and third sector agencies, Selina’s passion is working with people and adding value to everything she does. Outside of work, <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/team/selina-talbot/">Selina</a> is currently also studying a BSc (Hons) in Business and Management with Derby University.</p>
<p>In moving up from Account Executive to Account Manager, <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/team/molly/">Molly</a> brings her considerable SEO and client liaison experience to the new role, and will now have the opportunity to use her already highly proficient project management and marketing abilities to develop clients’ digital strategies further.</p>
<p>Molly, Selina and Tayler will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to the agency, helping to further round out our in-house capabilities, besides augmenting an already impressive team of creative, web and digital capabilities, designers, developers, inventors, strategists, artists and storytellers.</p>
<p>Harrison Carloss’ Managing Director Adam Mobley commented:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“It’s always a real pleasure to have talented and highly motivated people join us whilst also recognising our existing team, especially as with their help I know we can continue to deliver the very best for our existing and new clients. The past year has already seen us enjoy sustained growth with a number of significant client wins after we weathered the storm of the last couple of years, we are now looking forward to the future of Harrison Carloss. The business will also be turning 50 this year so for all of us this is going to be the beginning of yet another exciting chapter for the agency.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>We’re an innovative and creative gang, passionate about launching and growing brands. Check out our <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/jobs/">vacancies</a> page for the latest roles at Harrison Carloss.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>12 months. 365 days. 1 lockdown (so far). Maybe it wasn&#8217;t the year we were expecting but throughout 2021 we&#8217;ve been doing some pretty damn amazing work.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We designed and produced 1,053,765 pieces of printed collateral. Our talented dev team wrote 258,553 lines of code. Our account management team sent a whopping 34,743 emails. We scheduled 2184 social media posts. Wrote 132 monthly plans and much more. All in a year&#8217;s work for Harrison Carloss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do hope you’ve enjoyed a good 2021 too. Here’s a brief recap on what’s been going on for us over the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So where do we begin?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Let’s jump straight into the Harrison Carloss Customer Portal. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We launched our smart portal back in August to make it super easy for clients to access useful information about their account. The portal allows clients to manage their websites, warranties, check their marketing reports, Google Analytics, and get general support, all in one convenient, one-stop place. They can also access monthly website updates, Google Analytics data, marketing metrics &#8211; it’s all there at their fingertips. Neat, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Meet Tayler and Selina, our latest staff additions. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tayler is a <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/team/tayler-nuttall/">Creative Designer</a> who reckons all the best designers are geeks &#8211; her included &#8211; admitting she couldn’t imagine doing anything but design. Well, maybe a professional pizza taster. Selina, <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/team/selina-talbot/">one of our Account Execs</a>, is another geek, in her case it’s for marketing and people, and she combines the two at Harrison Carloss. She describes herself as a problem solver, marketing idea generator, innovator and professional juggler.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Awards nominations? 9 at the last count.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve actually been nominated for 9 awards in The Drum Recommends Digital Awards, The Drum Recommends Marketing &amp; Advertising Awards, and the Prolific North Awards. We might also mention that, in addition, we’ve featured in The Northern Agency Guide 2021 for the second year running. There’s no escaping the fact that a lot of people love the way we work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>And then there’s our Google Partner status.  </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We achieved the <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/why-you-should-work-with-a-google-partner-agency/">Google Partner</a> accolade all thanks to the hard work and dedication of several members of the HC team who gained their qualifications for successfully managing and improving our clients’ Google Ad accounts. It means that we demonstrated Google Ads skill and expertise, met Google ad spend requirements, delivered company, agency and client revenue growth, and sustained and grown our client base.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Yes, a pretty busy year all round. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now we’d just like to say a great big thank you to all of our lovely clients. We couldn’t have done it without you. Now we’re looking forward to an even busier 2022.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And while we’re on the subject of next year, there’s one more thing&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We’re going for Gold! </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’ll never guess what, so we’ll open up. 2022 marks the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the day we at Harrison Carloss first opened our doors for business. Imagine! 50 golden years in business! Who said congratulations are in order? Naturally we have a few anniversary-marking things planned but we’re keeping those under wraps until the big reveal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See you all for another exciting year in 2022!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Harrison Carloss, the strategic creative agency with over 40 years of successful marketing know-how to its name, has boosted its digital and creative design team with the addition of some fresh new talent.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chelsea joins the agency as a front end developer, while Chris brings with him digital design skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a year’s web design at one of the UK&amp;I’s largest technology distribution and specialist service providers, <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/team/chelsea-colclough/">Chelsea</a> was lead digital designer at Staffordshire University. She then spent 18 months as a front end web developer working on websites, SEO, DMS, lead management and online sales software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before joining HC, and following a 1<sup>st</sup> class honours design degree at Staffordshire University, <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/team/chris-mobley/">Chris</a> won a young super yacht designer award in 2018. He then did design work on yachts in Falmouth, and subsequently worked in a design and project management role in the Midlands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The addition of Chelsea and Chris further strengthens the agency’s in-house creative, web and digital capabilities, and augments an already impressive team of designers, developers, inventors, strategists, artists and storytellers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Staffordshire’s oldest established and longest running creative agency, Harrison Carloss are renowned for producing a long series of <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/projects/">highly successful campaigns</a> for many well-known global, national and regional brands, gathering many awards and achievements along the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last 18 months Harrison Carloss has enjoyed an extraordinary period of expansion that has seen significant growth in the agency’s client list, together with an increase in the digital side of the business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are very pleased to say that the agency has weathered the Covid-19 storm remarkably well and, true to form, we have been supporting clients and businesses with a a full range of marketing services which include <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/website-design-and-development/">web design</a>, branding and marketing strategy, direct mail, advertising, design for print and print management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Said Harrison Carloss MD Adam Mobley, “We’re absolutely delighted to welcome Chelsea and Chris to our highly talented team. I’ve no doubt that with their abilities we can build on our achievements over the past 18  months, and continue to deliver the very best for our existing and new clients.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, not really… <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/team/adam-mobley/">Adam</a> has been the MD of Harrison Carloss for a while now, but we have officially separated from <a href="http://myclevergroup.com/">My Clever Group</a>. It’s been an amazing 18 months as part of the Group but it’s time we flew the nest.</p>
<p>We’ve achieved such a lot in such a short space of time; we fully rebranded to Harrison Carloss, <a href="https://harrisoncarloss.com/harrison-carloss-takes-on-yet-more-top-talent/">gained new team members</a>, put in a huge amount of time and effort to enhance our digital, web design and web development services, produced some outstanding work for clients to build on our long reputation as a leading creative agency, and, most importantly, we gained some lovely new clients along the way.</p>
<p>“It’s been fantastic seeing Harrison Carloss go from strength to strength over the last 18 months,” he said, “Knowing that I’ve played a central role in that journey along with the team. With a background in design and technology, it’s something that I’m personally passionate about.”</p>
<p>At the time of Adam’s management buyout, we had already grown our portfolio of clients significantly under his leadership and direction, working with a number of well-known businesses both locally and nationwide since our rebrand. Adam will now continue in his role as Managing Director, taking on full commercial responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the business.</p>
<p>Gareth also commented: “I’m a huge believer in the power of marketing. It was undoubtedly a significant factor in helping us to build my previous business, <a href="https://www.solidor.co.uk/">Solidor</a> into the high growth, well-known business that it was then and still is to this day. The team at Harrison Carloss, led by Adam, have already achieved such a lot in a short amount of time, and I’ll continue to support the business with its plans for growth.”</p>
<h6>So what’s next for Staffordshire’s longest running creative marketing agency?</h6>
<p>Says Adam, “I’m now looking forward to building on the agency’s past successes and continuing to push the business forward, to deliver the very best for clients, both existing and new, in the future.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Just recently, Harrison Carloss got together with <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/net-magazine">Net Magazine</a> for a chat about our four decade history, what&#8217;s in the future for the agency and where we see the industry heading as a whole. Here’s an edited version of that meeting:</p>



<h6> Ne<strong>t Magazine</strong>: </h6>



<p>“Harrison Carloss has been described as both one of Staffordshire&#8217;s oldest and youngest creative agencies. On the one hand, it has a 40-year pedigree as HCL Marketing (Harrison Carloss Ltd), creating a string of successful campaigns for the likes of Dr Martens, Evo-Stik, MHA and Shell. On the other, its acquisition by My Clever Group was followed by a period of transformation, which saw it strengthen its creative and digital services and eventually relaunch under its original name of Harrison Carloss &#8211; but with a new identity. </p>



<p>“Repositioned
as a strategic creative marketing agency focusing heavily on web and digital
transformation, Harrison Carloss now has its eye firmly on the future. We spoke
to creative director Rich Urwin, web developer Joe Ciavucco and digital
designer Luke Brookes to find out what that future looks like.” </p>



<h6> <strong>Net Magazine:</strong> </h6>



<p><strong>“So how did Harrison Carloss come about?”</strong></p>



<h6> <strong>Rich Urwin: </strong></h6>



<p><strong>“</strong>In the 1970s, John Harrison and Michael Carloss started a traditional ad agency. Harrison Carloss was created and found itself well placed to take advantage of the rapid growth in the regional advertising and marketing industry. Over the years the company changed its name to HCL to keep up with moving trends but still identify with its founders. Until its recent acquisition, where it went back to its roots to capitalise on Harrison Carloss and its history.</p>



<p>“We
work together on every project, with everyone having input in each stage of the
process and the projects are so much stronger for it. A creative studio should
be full of humour and character; this ultimately makes your work better and
makes you work harder.”</p>



<h6> <strong>Net Magazine</strong>:  </h6>



<p><strong>“What&#8217;s the web design scene like in Staffordshire? Is there one?” </strong></p>



<h6> <strong>Joe Ciavucco:</strong> </h6>



<p><strong>“</strong>Harrison Carloss is paving the way for web design and development in the area. Outside of the big-agency areas like Manchester and London, creativity can die off, with agencies being more concerned about the speed and profitability of projects than creativity and innovation. </p>



<p>“We
see far too many purchased WordPress templates being thrown onto clients&#8217; sites
in the area, which leaves a huge gap for us to create incredible bespoke
experiences. I can see many other agencies over the next few years hiring new
talent as they move away from basic themes into more bespoke design to try and
keep up with us. </p>



<p>“We&#8217;re
hoping to kickstart the creative industry in Staffordshire and show we do have
a lot of talented people in the area. We&#8217;ve been quite heavily recruiting since
our rebrand. We&#8217;re seeing lots of young talent coming out of Staffordshire
colleges and universities embracing newer web technologies, which is really
great to see and again a sign of the growing popularity of the industry in the
area.”</p>



<h6> <strong>Net Magazine:</strong>  </h6>



<p><strong>“Are you recruiting and, if so, what kind of web designers are you looking for?”</strong></p>



<h6> <strong>Rich Urwin:</strong>  </h6>



<p>“We&#8217;re currently looking for both a full stack and front-end developer. The unique position we&#8217;re in allows new recruits to work on a multitude of high­ profile projects, in different sectors and using multiple technologies.” </p>



<h6> <strong>Net Magazine:</strong>  </h6>



<p><strong>”In what ways do you think your job might change in the 2020s?” </strong></p>



<h6> <strong>Joe Ciavucco:</strong> </h6>



<p>“We&#8217;re getting really excited at the potential projects we have coming in and I can see all the developers here being incredibly busy for the next few years with the projects we have ahead. My job is continuously changing as web technology is always moving forwards at an unstoppable rate, meaning developers have to be consistently learning. I&#8217;m excited for what technologies lie ahead in the 2020s.” &nbsp;</p>



<h6> <strong>Rich Urwin:</strong> </h6>



<p>“As creative director of both Harrison Carloss and My Clever Group, I see my position staying the same but driving the creative forward even more aggressively to push boundaries and create groundbreaking work that makes us stand out. Not all things that convert have to be boring/corporate and we&#8217;re going to prove it.” </p>

<h3><strong>In a move that continues to strengthen its digital offering, HCL is delighted to announce the appointment of the first three key team members in its expansion plans.</strong>&nbsp; </h3>



<p>Rich Urwin has joined as Creative Director to head up the
agency’s concept creation and design services. Also joining are Luke Brookes as
Digital Designer, and Joe Ciavucco as Web Developer. Having previously worked
at the likes of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, they have a wealth of experience between
them working on high-profile projects, creating innovative and distinctive
work. HCL is now in an ideal position to expand its offering to both new
and existing clients.</p>



<p>The appointments come soon after the acquisition of HCL
Marketing (Harrison Carloss Ltd.), Staffordshire’s longest running marketing
communications company, by MyCleverGroup based on Festival Park in its
20,000 sq ft HQ.</p>



<p>HCL is a full-service creative marketing agency whose team has produced a string of highly successful campaigns
and digital assets for a long list of well-known global, national and regional
brands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>The agency offers a complete range of marketing services
including web design, digital marketing, branding and marketing strategy, email

management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gareth Mobley, CEO of MCG, commented, “We are very
excited to welcome Rich, Luke and Joe to the team. They are a great fit for our
culture here at MCG. This is just the beginning of MyCleverGroup’s recruitment process and ongoing investment in
the agency to cement its place as a sector leader in the area and beyond. We’re
building on HCL’s long-standing foundations as we continue to grow our in-house
capabilites, increasing the focus on world-class digital, app development, data
analytics and cloud-based software systems.</p>



<p>Our mission at HCL is to offer our clients a truly first-class
service to go along with the highest levels of creativity and digital
innovation.”</p>

<h3><strong>One of Staffordshire’s longest established marketing companies is reborn after being acquired by MyCleverGroup</strong></h3>



<p>An exciting new era begins for one of Staffordshire’s longest running and most experienced marketing communications companies.</p>



<p>HCL Marketing (Harrison Carloss Ltd.) which first opened its doors in the 1970s, has been acquired by MyCleverGroup, located in the vibrant heart of Festival Park. The move now sees HCL operate out of the world class facility created by MyCleverGroup to help its business-2-business offering grow.</p>



<p>HCL is a full-service creative marketing agency which, over the years, has created a string of highly successful campaigns for clients including Dr. Martens, Evo-stik, MHA, Shell, The ExtraCare Charitable Trust, Arco, Staffordshire Tourism, Churchill China, and many other well known National and regional brands.   </p>



<p><strong>The agency offers a complete range of marketing services including web design, digital marketing, branding and marketing strategy, direct mail, advertising, design for print and print management. </strong></p>



<p>MyCleverGroup’s CEO, Gareth Mobley, said ‘As part of MyCleverGroup, HCL is now in an ideal position to expand and offer its wealth of marketing experience and extensive services to new and existing clients. The agency’s working ethos and track record are a perfect fit with the values of MyCleverGroup as we grow our own capabilites in assisting businesess with marketing and end-to-end digitalisation.</p>



<p>‘MyCleverGroup is expecting a flurry of further key acquisitions and a number of key appointments over the next 12 months to fulfil its mission of helping empower hundreds of businesses using the latest technology. By leveraging clever yet simple technology, marketing and digitalisation, we can help drive top line growth and profitability, while enhancing both customer and colleague engagement.’</p>



<p>MyCleverGroup has already begun investing heavily in HCL, building on its existing stable foundations and growing its in-house capabilites to increase the service offering, with a big focus on digital, app development, data analytics and cloud based software systems.</p>



<p>Gareth continues: ‘It’s often hard for most businesses to understand all of the jargon surrounding the use of tech; the benefits are frequently unclear, and their practical application even murkier. For those reasons we want to make the use of technology in your business simple by creating a one-stop-shop that takes the pain away. This is a hugely exciting time to be a part of MCG, and we are very pleased to have the team at HCL on board. We recently invested £2m in our HQ on Festival park, and we are going to fill it with the area’s top talent.’ </p>
