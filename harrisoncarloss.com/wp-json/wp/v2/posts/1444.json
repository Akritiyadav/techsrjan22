And, uses over 200 ranking signals. But when it comes to search engines, you have got to ace the race. We often focus on the algorithm but we forget all this effort serves a single purpose: Satisfy the user.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a danger of SEO &#8220;specialists&#8221; &#8220;Gurus&#8221; or any other buzz word we can think of, to become overly focused on SEO. Of course it\u2019s important \u2013 but so is the user experience. It\u2019s quite common for websites to be so focused on other aspects of SEO that the user experience is poor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, we are familiar with the idea that \u201ccontent is king\u201d, therefore make tons of great content and visitors will come. But unfortunately it\u2019s a rather outdated statement. Today great content is just not enough \u2014 Satisfaction is an actual ranking factor, and it doesn\u2019t come solely from the relevant content but also the Website Interface and User Experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to emphasise a keyword. It&#8217;s much more difficult to stop visitors from clicking the back button on your website when they don&#8217;t find what they\u2019re looking for. Satisfaction is very difficult to deal with \u2014 perhaps that&#8217;s why Google and other search engines place so much attention on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>User Experience Metrics<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Bounce rate, time on site and returning visitors are User Experience metrics.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There are still some SEO guru&#8217;s who do not believe in User Experience. But when we are talking about user experience, we are talking about how fast the pages load, how easy it is for visitors to navigate around your website and to find what they are looking for, how awesome your website is on the eye, amongst other factoring elements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Practically if you do these, you are improving user experience. And guess what, the number one reason why everyone is not improving User Experience is because apparently it\u2019s expensive to hire a creative UX agency when they have a cousin who once worked at google and that once tried to design a website. But hear this out:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cIf you think good design is expensive, you should look at the cost of bad design\u201c<\/em>&nbsp;\u2014 Dr Ralf Speth, CEO Jaguar.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Metric #1: Page Loading Speed<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The UX begins when the user clicks on your website. If they have to wait ten seconds or more for your site to load, they will leave your site. Site speed has long been a factor in SEO rankings, but it also provides users with a first impression of your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottom line is that longer load times directly affect your conversions and ultimately your bottom line as a result. According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kissmetrics.com\/loading-time\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a study done by Kissmetrics<\/a>, every second past the ideal loading time of three seconds costs you a 7% reduction in sales!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Metric #2: Site Navigation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Something that defines a high-quality UX is how quickly and easily visitors can access various parts of your site. The best way to ensure is this is through the use of effectively designed menus and submenus. As a rule, make sure it doesn\u2019t take more than two to three clicks for visitors to find anything on your site. One click for the category, and one for the post or page. Anything more and you risk overcomplicating the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Metric #3: Mobile Responsiveness<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In April 2015, Google released a new algorithm update that focused on sites that were mobile responsive. This term refers to a website\u2019s ability to display itself in a readable format on both a desktop and a mobile device. If it looks great on one, but looks poor on another, then Google\u2019s update tanked their search rankings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it became clearer that Google is all about a high-quality UX. Since most people are now browsing the web on mobile devices, this kind of approach makes sense. People should be able to have the same level of quality on their mobile devices, especially since they use them primarily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>User behaviour in search results<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We read an article that describes how Google engineers figured out how to improve search results by mining their user behaviour data:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8230;Google could see how satisfied users were &#8230;The best sign of their happiness was the &#8216;long click&#8217; \u2013 this occurred when someone went to a search result, ideally the top one, and did not return. That meant Google has successfully fulfilled the query. But unhappy users were unhappy in their own ways, most telling were the &#8216;short clicks&#8217; where a user followed a link and immediately returned to try again. &#8220;If people type something and then go and change their query, you could tell they aren\u2019t happy,&#8221; says Patel. &#8220;If they go to the next page of results, it\u2019s a sign they\u2019re not happy.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do YOU improve satisfaction?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two types of SEOs: those that try to satisfy robots, and those that satisfy users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The robot-focused SEOs build pages with just the right keywords and title tags, hoping to attract the bots on relevancy. I say &#8220;try&#8221; to satisfy robots, because search engines are actually watching the users. If the users aren&#8217;t happy, neither are the bots.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The user-focused SEOs works with the same keywords and title tag, but then they go one step further and ask their users to try the site. After that, they do whatever it takes to make their users happy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until next time&#8230;.
