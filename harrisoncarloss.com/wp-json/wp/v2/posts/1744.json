What could have been just another ad in a commercial break became a hard-hitting part of the prime time TV show. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dec told viewers: \u201cRight now, we\u2019re going to do something\nthat\u2019s never been done before. We\u2019re going to pause this show to make time for\neveryone there at home to get together and talk. Whatever you need to do &#8211; grab\nthe kids, wake dad up, or just turn and talk to a mate. We\u2019re pausing BGT for a\nminute so you can talk.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The programme was then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.campaignlive.co.uk\/article\/itv-britain-talking-uncommon-creative-studio\/1661607\">silent for a full minute<\/a> while clips aired of the crew backstage holding up cards that read: \u201cUse our silence to talk to each other.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two presenters told the show\u2019s audience that \u201cIt\u2019s so\nimportant for our wellbeing to get together with people we care about and talk.\u201d\nAs they reminded us, there are more distractions then ever these days. If we\u2019re\nnot watching TV, we\u2019re looking at our phones. It was effectively an acknowledgement\nthat TV and social media prevent kids from talking to their family when they\nneed help. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6>Who is involved?<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<p>The \u2018Britain Get Talking\u2019 campaign, supported by <a href=\"https:\/\/youngminds.org.uk\/\">YoungMinds<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mind.org.uk\/news-campaigns\/news\/mind-responds-to-itv-announcing-new-mental-wellbeing-campaign-to-help-get-families-closer\/\">Mind<\/a>, brings together some of ITV\u2019s favourite stars including Corrie\u2019s Alexandra Mardell, Jonathan Ross, Robert Peston, Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby, to raise awareness of the fact that levels of anxiety and depression among British children have risen by 48% since 2004. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the charity Mind, one in four people in the UK\nwill be affected by a mental health problem this year, while one in six will\nexperience a common mental health problem in any given week. The campaign aims\nto combat this by encouraging everyone to \u2018tune back into the story in your\nliving room.\u2019 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6>the power of silence<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<p>Also featured within the campaign is a \u2018silent ad break\u2019\nwhere, in a continuous one-take silent sequence, five sponsoring brands appear\nand hold up cards supporting the Britain Get Talking campaign. Simple and\neffective. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a lot to like about this campaign, not least of\nwhich is that nobody involved is just jumping on the mental health bandwagon\nmerely to promote themselves.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beginning with Ant and Dec\u2019s surprise intro, through its highly relevant message, the concept and execution work hard for this important issue from start to finish. It should get a lot of people talking.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6>HEY, YOU! YES, YOU!<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<p>Like what you\u2019ve read?
