Besides using them to order and to make your payment, they have the added safety advantage of eliminating the need to queue next to other people.<\/p>\n<p>A further important benefit of personal apps is the way they allow easier contact tracing through your billing address should you have become exposed to COVID-19 during your meal.<\/p>\n<p>And then there\u2019s the way apps such as those of Deliveroo, JustEat, Uber Eats and other new platforms are able to link diners with restaurants without the customer needing to leave the house.<\/p>\n<p>Pre-pandemic, many restaurants and hospitality venues simply didn\u2019t have any of this tech in place. Now they\u2019re finding it an indispensable means of safely promoting direct customer engagement, enhancing customer experience, and securing the future of their business.<\/p>\n<p>So take your cue from hospitality, technology and innovation is the way forward, and, you never know, it might just stick.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h6>Living your own hospitality hell?<\/h6>\n<p>Get in touch with our expert team to find out how we can provide technical marketing support and development for your business.
