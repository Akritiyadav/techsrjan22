Well Chilly\u2019s new campaign for their Series 2 drinking bottles and cups is just as cool, and gives <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chillysbottles.com\/uk\">Chilly\u2019s<\/a> an unrivalled style lead in the reusable bottles market.<\/p>\n<p><strong>10 years of Chilly&#8217;s<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Chilly\u2019s was founded in 2010 by James Butterfield and Tim Bouscarle, two guys who wanted to give people the ability to always have cold water on-the-go, without having to buy single-use plastic water bottles.<\/p>\n<p>Their mission was to accelerate the adoption and everyday use of reusable products. They aimed to do this by \u2018creating products for an active urban lifestyle, with the perfect balance of distinctive style and unrivalled performance.\u2019<\/p>\n<p><strong>Performance AND Design<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Their approach resulted in the original iconic Chilly\u2019s bottle, recognised for its distinctive designs and never-let-you-down performance. As Chilly\u2019s website says, they keep your hot drinks hot for 12 hours, and your cold drinks cold for 24 hours.<\/p>\n<p>They also made you look pretty cool. You could get a Chilly\u2019s bottle with a graphic image of London, Paris, New York or Sydney printed on it. Or gradient colours and finishes such as stainless steel, chrome, neon, and a whole spread of other colours and designs. Or an Emma Bridgewater design (we are from <a href=\"https:\/\/harrisoncarloss.com\/contact\/stoke\/\">Stoke<\/a> after all).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Eco-friendly ethos<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In line with the company\u2019s aim to accelerate the adoption of reusable products, Chilly\u2019s then partnered with non profit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.citytosea.org.uk\/\">City to Sea<\/a>, who work to prevent plastic pollution in the ocean.<\/p>\n<p>In an award-winning Campaign to promote the Chilly\u2019s Refill and encourage the reduction of single-use plastics, Chilly\u2019s introduced the Sea Life range with four new designs to coincide with World Oceans Day, featuring the work of Cornwall artist Will the Artist. As part of that campaign, Chilly\u2019s donated 10% of all sales to City to Sea.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A new dawn, a new design<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now, after 3 years of design work, we have the Series 2 Chilly\u2019s Bottle, \u2018not a redesign but an evolution of the original iconic design\u2019 say Chilly\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p>From the customisable carry loop to soft touch antimicrobial drinking collar, everything about Series 2 has evolved. It features an even more sleekly modern and stylish bottle, beautifully designed to combine the convenience of a plastic water bottle, with the high performance technology and eco-friendly benefits of a traditional flask.<\/p>\n<p>For Series 2 there\u2019s again a Chilly\u2019s coffee cup. It too has double walled technology to keep your hot drinks hot inside while staying cool to the touch on the outside in typical Chilly\u2019s style.
