The whole thing is held together by a kaleidoscopic backing of UK dance music and ambient SFX.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMaking ads for over a year in the pandemic has tuned us in really tightly to the pressure points in the collective psyche,\u201d said Tenser, \u201cand this was the well we drew from &#8211; everything we have learned in the past year.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Real life searches.\u00a0 <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It seems that once they had the narrative they wanted, they gave the script &#8211; in essence a sequence of search queries &#8211; to Google\u2019s data insight team. They then cross-referenced what had been written with the most realistic possible live searches, adjusting the script to make it true to what people would actually type into the search bar.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>A mirror of life. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Said Tenser, \u201cGoogle isn\u2019t just for the small transactions like banana bread recipes and directions to\u00a0dry cleaners. We often search for the big stuff, too. It was very much intended to be a mirror up to U.K. life, U.K. people. Something that smelled like us &#8211; and only us &#8211; right now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Nils Leonard, co-founder, Uncommon Creative Studio added: \u201cTrivial terms tell the story of our hopes and unknowns, the smallest search can mean everything. We find each other there. Uncommon are proud to bring the Google brand story to the UK as we all enter the Summer of our lives.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The campaign premiered Tuesday June 1 during Channel 4\u2019s \u2018Great British Bake Off: The Professionals\u2019, going on to cover all channels, accompanied by digital &amp; poster OOH across iconic locations in the UK.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Searching for more.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Google has really tugged on heartstrings with the latest campaign and it&#8217;s clear to see the impact of the use of data to create authenticity. In a time where we&#8217;re looking to move on from Covid-19 restrictions, they&#8217;ve really managed to embrace the mood of the nation &#8211; both the good and the bad &#8211; to create an ad that exudes optimism in the time when it&#8217;s needed most.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to make genuine connections with your customers, why not get in touch with the team at Harrison Carloss?
