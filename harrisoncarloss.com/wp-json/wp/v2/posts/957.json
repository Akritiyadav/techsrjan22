The myopic view of \u201conly what I relate to has value\u201d, often delivered by characters that Myers Briggs would describe as \u201cintroverted yet intuitive\u201d. Probably the most infuriating case.<\/li><li>The \u2018self-publicist\u2019 \u2013 I\u2019ve done some media training, I am on social media and I can use Powerpoint, so I understand everything about the subject of marketing.<\/li><li>\u2018I worked in sales and read Philip Kotler\u2019 \u2013 Marketing people often lack direct sales experience but the reverse is also true for sales people who assume they know marketing. The two are different arts, both of which require practical experience to master.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Results<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The impact of all these \u201cviews\u201d tends to generate two types of marketing leaders:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The alpha leader,<\/strong>&nbsp;who ignores all comments and adopts the raging bull stance to barge ideas through at any cost. On the plus side this gives a consistent approach, but fails to engage the business\u2019s most important brand communicators \u2013 its people \u2013 who maythen fail to understand the brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The consensual leader,<\/strong>&nbsp;who takes notice of all comments and changes direction every quarter \u2013 leading to a lack of consistency and a brand which becomes more internally focussed than externally driven.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The views I took most notice of were those which started with \u201cwhen I was talking to our customers about this\u2026\u201d or \u201cI think our customers will think this\u2026\u201d Because putting ourselves in our customers\u2019 shoes is what we try and do every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why only marketing?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t see such a correlation of this syndrome in other professions. When was the last time you heard a senior colleague critique the finance team for their treatment of straight line depreciation? Or IT\u2019s policy on cloud based storage?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But an opinion is better than no opinion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As my career developed I came to see the \u2018marketing experts syndrome\u2019 as a challenge which keeps you on your game. It\u2019s also great for developing both the art of persuasion and the skill of diplomacy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also reminded me of one important fact. If senior colleagues are interested in marketing, that is inherently a good thing. Because the alternative is to been seen as an unimportant function which just does fluff. And who wants to do that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to raise the standing of your marketing, get in contact.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Maybe it\u2019s just me, but when I worked in-house, it was amazing how many colleagues (often those near the top) were closet marketing experts.
